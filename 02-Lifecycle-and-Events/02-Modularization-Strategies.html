  <li>Understand some common modularization strategies.</li>
  <li>Be able to make choices about component structure.</li>

<h2>Reusability</h2>
<p>When we talk about components and the benefits that Vue provides against other front-end solutions, one of the most
  obvious advantages is reusability. Components can be created once and reused everywhere throughout the front-end.
  While many front-end frameworks provide this advantage, consider the traditional alternative. For every page on our
  website we need a separate HTML file. If we wanted to have a relatively complex page, we could end up with hundreds of
  lines of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On top of that, if we want our pages to look consistent, we need to be really
  careful about organizing our CSS so that it's reusable and adding classes to our HTML in a consistent way. If we want
  ia page to have an element that looks just like an element on a different page, we have to copy and paste the code we
  wrote. Worse, if we want to change a common element, we'll have to change it in all of our HTML files. This is no way
  to work!</p>
<p>With Vue, we can write our components in such a way that each component is responsible for its own functionality and
  styling, and composing those smaller components into a larger page. That sounds easy in theory, but can be much more
  difficult in practice. How do we figure out what should be a component and what shouldn't be? Often times, the answer
  to this question is more art than science. Fortunately, Vue projects are easy to change as you go, and you'll learn a
  ton by building apps and reorganizing them. <strong>Don't be afraid to mess things up and rewrite them!</strong></p>
<h2>Making Component Decisions</h2>
<p>There are many factors you'll likely be taking into account when you're deciding whether or not an element on your
  page should be a its own component. Here, we'll give you a few pointers to get started as well as some examples to
  provide additional clarity. Remember, if you don't know what your app will look like or how it will work, you're not
  ready to write any code yet. Always start with at least a wireframe to inform your judgment before you start the
  planning stage. That being said let's jump right in!</p>
<p>Here are just a few reasons to create a new component:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The page element will be found on multiple pages, like a header bar.</li>
  <li>The page element will have similar styling and functionality to others throughout the app, like a button.</li>
  <li>The page element will manage its own state, and consistently pass properties down to its children. We'll talk more
    about this in later lessons.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is by no means an exhaustive list, but you'll start to get a feel for it in time, and soon enough you'll be
  making your own tradeoffs. For now, let's look at how you might organize a few popular web pages into components.</p>
