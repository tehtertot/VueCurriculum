<h1>Assignment: Component Structure</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Practice modularizing a wireframe into different components</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Before we get started writing another application, let's reinforce the planning process by breaking a few wireframes into separate components. Don't worry too much about doing this the "right" way. You'll learn from yourself and others all sorts of little things that will make your life easier down the road. Do this to the best of your ability and see how your opinions evolve by the time you're done with the course!</p>
