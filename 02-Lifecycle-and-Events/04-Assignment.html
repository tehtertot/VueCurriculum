<h1>Assignment: Component Structure</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Practice modularizing a wireframe into different components</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>
  Before we get started writing another application, let's reinforce the
  planning process by breaking a few wireframes into separate components. Don't
  worry too much about doing this the "right" way. You'll learn from yourself
  and others all sorts of little things that will make your life easier down the
  road. Do this to the best of your ability and see how your opinions evolve by
  the time you're done with the course!
</p>
<p>
  Don't write any code for this assignment unless you're ahead. Use a whiteboard
  or a desktop drawing tool (you can use Zoom) to draw boxes around your
  components and determine whether they will be stateful or stateless, and which
  components should manage which data.
