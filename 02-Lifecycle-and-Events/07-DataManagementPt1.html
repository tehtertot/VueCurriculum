<h2>Data Management in Vue</h2>
<p>We're really close to starting our first real application, but before we can take the leap, we need to learn one last critical piece of the puzzle. For almost every single web application to be useful, it has to come in contact with data. It can be as simple as updating the numbers in a calculator app or as complex as managing multiple playlists on Spotify. Eventually, we'll be handing this responsibility, at least in part, to vuex, but for now it's important to understand how we might tackle the problem on our own.</p>
<p>We've already covered data management in a single component. This is great when the component can be responsible for its own information, but it falls short when we need the component to share information with the rest of the application. That sounds nice, but what exactly does it mean? Let's say we have a dice rolling app that allows you to click a button and get a random roll of two different dice. The dice component can handle both dice and which number they render, no biggie. But now what if we want to create a dice game, where a player can take on multiple artificial players in a game where the highest roll takes all the proverbial marbles. Well, this gets more complicated. How do we know who won? Our dice component can be reused for each player, and each individual component can be responsible for knowing its corresponding score, but that's just it, they cannot yet be aware of the scores around them. Ideally, we'd have a place where all of the components can send their data for all other components to read and that some component higher up (parent/ancestor) can be responsible for calculating who won. Enter, the store...</p>
<h2>The Store</h2>
<p>The idea of a global store for application information is ubiquitous. It's so popular, in fact, that libraries like Redux (a React library for implementing application stores) have been rewritten or adopted in some form in almost every major front-end framework over the last few years. As stated earlier, we won't be using Redux (or Vue's flavor Vuex) until the next chapter, but we will be implementing some of the same ideas on our own, so make these next few lessons count!</p>
<p>The idea of a store is that we'll use a global object that exists somewhere in our application. This object has both properties and methods. The properties are the source of truth for all the shared data in our application and the methods are how we will update those properties. Vue will listen for updates to any of our store's properties and update <strong>only</strong> the components that are relying on the properties that have changed. Let's let that sink in for a minute. Vue will <strong>only</strong> update the components that are using the properties that have changed. This is part of what makes front-end frameworks like Vue and React so incredibly powerful, fast, and downright cool.</p>
<p>Hopefully you're feeling confident knowing that the store is just an object. So let's take a look at how we might implement one in the next lesson.</p>
