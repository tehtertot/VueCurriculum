<p>As we develop web applications for users, authentication is a very important process to consider. <b>Authentication</b> is the process of verifying that someone is who they say they are. So far, none of our applications have utilized this process--anyone could walk up and play Ninja Gold or browse through the applications we've made; but suppose we did want it to matter. What if we wanted to keep track of Ninja Gold high scores or a history of game play per user? You have probably used dozens of sites that require you to <em>authenticate</em> by signing in with some combination of username and password or log in via an existing account like Google, Facebook, or GitHub.</p>
<p>While this is certainly something we could manage internally in our application (by saving usernames and encrypted passwords into a database and then checking that database each time a user logs in), we are going to utilize a third-party API, namely Firebase, to assist us with this process. We can trust a provider like Google to ensure our data is secure, and that way, we don't have to be experts in security; instead, we can focus on the heart of our application!</p>
<h3>Firebase Setup</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Open your project in the Firebase console, if it isn't open already.</li>
    <li>On the left navigation bar, under "Develop," click "Authentication."</li>
    <li>In the main pane, select the "Sign-in method" tab.</li>
    <li>Under "Provider," click on Email/Password to edit it. Click the "Enable" toggle to turn this option on. (For now, leave the Email link (passwordless sign-in toggled off).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Vue App Setup</h3>
<p>The Firebase Auth service has several useful methods that abstract away the complexities of login and registration. To follow along in the documentation, you can find it <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.auth.Auth.html?authuser=0#createuserwithemailandpassword">here</a>.</p>
