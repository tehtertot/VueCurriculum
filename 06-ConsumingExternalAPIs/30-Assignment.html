<h1>Assignment: Login/Registration</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new Vue application with Firebase</li>
    <li>Set up a basic login/registration page to prepare for the next assignment</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>We have deliberately not provided you every single line of code for setting up the login and registration for your application, because it's time for you to start putting all the pieces together! As we make full-stack web applications, we want you to begin to feel confident about each of the different pieces we've learned, understand their purpose, and use that understanding to practice putting all the pieces together.</p>
<p>Registering and logging in to an application is a very common task, and so this is a really great assignment to lead us into our final big assignment for this chapter. Build two components--one for logging in and one for registering, and add the Firebase authentication in the backend to help manage users. Upon successful registration or login, redirect the user to a simple success page.</p>
