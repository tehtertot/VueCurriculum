<p>For this assignment, we'll need both Firebase authentication and the Firestore. Once a user registers or logs in, they'll be redirected to a page where they are able to see all other users' posts. They'll also be able to "like" posts, and see the total number of likes each post has. Posts should be ordered with the newest post at the top.</p>
