<h1>Assignment: The Wall</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Integrate all the tools into one fully-functioning application</li>
    <li>Practice utilizing a database</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>For this assignment, we'll need both Firebase authentication and the Firestore. Once a user registers or logs in, they'll be redirected to a page where they are able to see all other users' posts. Be sure to also include a functional logout button, and only allow users who are signed in to view the wall.</p>
<p>As a bonus, allow users to be able to "like" posts (but only one like per post per user!), and see the total number of likes each post has. Posts should be ordered with the newest post at the top. (Think arrays!)</p>
