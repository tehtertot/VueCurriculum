<h1>Assignment: TV Shows</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Practice integrating Firebase and Firestore into a Vue application</li>
    <li>Practice reading data from Firestore into Vue</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Create a new project in Firestore called DojoShows (feel free to be more creative with the name). Add a Firestore database to the project. Add a new collection called "shows" with at least 5 TV shows. While you can certainly add more fields, be sure each TV show has at least the following fields:</p>
<ul>
    <li>title</li>
    <li>network</li>
    <li>numberOfSeasons</li>
    <li>isCurrent</li>
    <li>genres</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, create a new Vue application with the same name. (The names don't have to match, but it really helps to keep things organized.) Set up the Vue application with all the necessary Firebase configurations. Display the TV shows from your Firestore database in your Vue application.</p>
