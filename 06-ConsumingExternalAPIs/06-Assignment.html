<h1>Assignment: GitHub Battle Part I</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new Vue application that uses axios</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>We'll keep this assignment simple to start. Over the next several modules and assignments, we'll build this out into something more fun!</p>
<p>GitHub also has an API available that allows us to see, among other things, different users' public statistics, including how many public repositories and followers they have. Create a new Vue application that makes a call to the GitHub API with your username and have it display your statistics:</p>
<p>https://api.github.com/users/your_username_here</p>
