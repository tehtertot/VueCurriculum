<p>Another resource that we're going to learn about now is Google's Firebase. While Firebase is more than an API, it has an API that we'll be integrating into our applications shortly. But first, let's learn what Firebase is.</p>
<p><b>Firebase</b> is a "Backend as a Service" (BaaS), which means that as developers, we can outsource the setup and maintenance of backend services to Firebase rather than having to manage them ourselves. Here are some of the services provided by Firebase:</p>
<h4>Authentication</h4>
<p>One tool that Firebase provides is <b>authentication</b>, which is important any time an application needs to know who is using the application. Whenever you log in to a website, your credentials are processed through some kind of authentication. The most traditional way of doing this is with an email/username and associated password--by providing those 2 pieces of information, you are confirming that you are who you say you are.</p>
<h4>Database</h4>
<p>Cloud Firestore is a database server hosted on the cloud. It is a NoSQL database, which means it is a non-relational, document-model database. It's okay if you're not sure what this means. For now, it's important to understand that a database is where we'll host all the data used in our application, and documents look a bit like JSON or JavaScript objects, with data made up of key-value pairs.</p>
<h4>Hosting</h4>
<p>So far, we've just been working off of our local machines. When we want to deploy our applications for the world to see and use, we'll need a <em>host</em>. Firebase provides such a service, allowing us to upload our application so that it can be accessible over the internet. Other hosting services include Microsoft's Azure, Amazon's AWS, DigitalOcean, and many more.</p>
<h4>Cloud Functions</h4>
<p>Sometimes, we may find ourselves in need of a relatively simple function, but don't necessarily need an entire web application to accomplish this task. To achieve this, Google's Firebase offers cloud functions. Competitors include Microsoft's Azure Function Apps and Amazon's AWS Lambda. These are often referred to as <em>serverless</em>. This term can be a little bit misleading, because there is certainly a server involved, but from the developer's perspective, we don't have to manage anything about the server, but can just focus on the function we want to run.</p>
<p>There are other Firebase offerings, but these are just a few big ones. We'll be working a lot with the first 2, and will also touch on hosting and functions.</p>
