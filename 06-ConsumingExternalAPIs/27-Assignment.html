<h1>Assignment: TV Shows - Full CRUD</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Integrate all CRUD operations in a Vue application</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>To finish up this TV shows assignment, let's add the final operations of updating and deleting. For updating, we'll actually need to add two steps. When the "update" link is clicked, the user should be shown a new page with a form. When that form is submitted, the show should be updated in the database accordingly.</p>
<p>Finally, when the "delete" link is clicked, it should remove that show from the database.</p>
