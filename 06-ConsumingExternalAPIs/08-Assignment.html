<h1>Assignment: GitHub Battle Part II</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Practice receiving user input</li>
    <li>Practice implementing axios asynchronously</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Building off of your previous GitHub assignment, expand the functionality so that instead of immediately loading your own GitHub account's statistics, a user can type in any username, click <em>Go</em>, and then display that user's statistics.</p>

<p>Note: We haven't explicitly discussed error handling yet, so don't worry about invalid inputs quite yet.</p>
