<h3>A quick overview.</h3>
<p>Modularization is an important concept for building Vue applications. In fact, it's what helps make Vue so powerful.
  Before we dive into the details, let's take a step back and talk about modularization in general.</p>
<p>Modularization is concept of breaking our code into separate files, or modules, so that our code becomes more
  manageable and maintainable. There's actually nothing Vue specific about modularization. Modulariztaion is widely used
  in programming in general to help manage codebases of all shapes and sizes. In fact, we've already used modularization
  in the past. Remember when we took our CSS and put it into a file separate from our HTML files? That's modularization!
</p>
<h4>How does modularization make our code more maintainable?</h4>
<p>Let's imagine a scenario where our app has started to gain traction, but we need to add more features to support our
  growing user base. After a little while, our App.vue file has gone from 100 lines of code to 5000 lines of code. Now,
  when we want to find a component, it might take minutes of searching before we can locate where it was defined. Once
  we find it, we may need to cross-reference it with another component, so we have to search for minutes once again.
  It's easy to see how this is unmanageable.</p>
<p>Enter modularization. We'll split all our components into separate files. Each component will be exported from the
  file where it's defined and imported into each file that relies on it. That way, it's easy to find everything just by
  looking at our folder hierarchy.</p>
<h3>Modularization in Vue</h3>
<p>When we create a new Vue app using the Vue CLI, we can see that Vue is already beginning to start the modularization
  process for us.</p>
