<h1>Assignment: Creating an Application with the CLI</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Practice using the Vue CLI to create an application</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>To help solidify the concepts we've just discussed, we're going to convert our previous application into a Vue application using the CLI.</p>
<p><b>Note: Moving forward, always have your browser's console open, checking for any warnings or errors!</b></p>

<ol>
    <li>Start by opening your terminal and navigating to where you are saving your Vue assignments.</li>
    <li>
        <p>Then run the command, accepting the default option when prompted:</p>
        <pre>vue create my-first-cli-app</pre>
    </li>
    <li><p>Once the application has been created, open the my-first-cli-app folder in your text editor.</p></li>
    <li><p>Replace the contents of the template, script, and style sections of the HelloWorld.vue file.</p>
        <p>Note: for this assignment, just the name is a variable</p>
    </li>
    <li>Update the App.vue file as needed.</li>
    <li>Once you've got everything working as expected, change the name of the HelloWorld component to LearningList.</li>
</ol>
