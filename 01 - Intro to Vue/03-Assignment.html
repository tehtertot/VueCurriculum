<h1>Assignment: Hello Vue World</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Create a Vue application</li>
    <li>Practice data-binding</li>
    <li>Practice previous concepts of HTML & CSS</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Now it's your turn to practice. Create a new folder called <code>my_first_vue</code> and add an HTML file, a JavaScript file, and a CSS file.</p>
<p>Note: Don't forget everything you learned about HTML and CSS in the beginning of this course! Even though we are adding some new things with Vue, the fundamentals still apply. You can link to and use CSS just as you did before. Eventually we'll learn about making the styling more dynamic, but let's take it one step at a time.</p>
<p>Make a page that displays a list of things you want to learn. Instead of hard-coding your name on the page, store that data in the Vue instance (i.e. something like this in your HTML: <code data-language="html">{{ name }}'s Things to Learn</code>).</p>
