<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Make a plan for the components you need to create.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you're still feeling a little bit uncertain, follow the pattern we've just walked through--have one component that contains the header and one component for the list. We'll have 2 instances of the list component.</li>
            <li>If you're feeling adventurous, try to break it down into a few more components.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p>Create a new project using the Vue CLI.</p></li>
    <li><p>Update the HelloWorld.vue and add any additional components necessary.</p></li>
    <li><p>Update the App.vue file as needed.</p></li>
