<h1>Our First Vue Application</h1>

  One of the nice things about Vue is how lightweight it is compared to other
  front-end frameworks. While we can spin up a server to host our web
  application, we can also just import it into our HTML file directly (much like
  adding the jQuery library to our HTML file).
</p>
<p>
  Let's get started by creating a folder called hello_vue and add one new HTML
  file to it. Along with the standard head elements, add the following:
</p>
<h4>hello_vue/index.html</h4>
<pre data-language="html">
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;!-- other meta tags --&gt;
        &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div id="app"&gt;
            Hello, {{ message }}
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  Open this page in your browser. What do you think you'll see? While it may
  look a little strange to you, the browser just reads all those characters
  literally.
</p>
<p>
  In Vue (and in many templating engines), the double curly brackets -- often
  referred to as <em>moustache</em> syntax :) -- are used to indicate
  <em><b>data binding</b></em
  >. This means that the expression inside the curly braces is <em>bound</em> to
  a value through JavaScript. So let's make that happen and make our first Vue
  application!
</p>
<p>
  Create a file called <code>index.js</code> in the same folder. With the import
  statement added in the head tags, one of the things we now have access to is
  to a function called Vue, which takes an object as an argument. There are
  several different values we can initialize, but to start, we'll just focus on
  two:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>el</b> - a <em>string</em> of the id of the element to which Vue should
    be applied, preceded by a # (same format as an id in css)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>data</b> - an <em>object</em> defining any variables being used, where
    the keys are the variable names
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>hello_vue/index.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
    var app = new Vue({
        el: "#app",
        data: {
            message: "Vue!"
        }
    })
</pre>
<p>
  Take a second to break down this code and understand the pieces. Remember:
  <code>Vue</code> is just the name of a function, and it takes one
  <em>argument in the form of an object</em>. In the first line, we're creating
  <em>a new Vue instance</em> and passing in 1 argument. That argument is an
  object with 2 key-value pairs. The first key, <code>el</code>, indicates this
  instance is applicable to the HTML element with the id of "app." The second
  key, <code>data</code>, is an object that has one key-value pair. Since we
  used the variable name "message" in our HTML (remember the double curly
  braces?), we use that same name as the key in our data object.
</p>
<p>
  Before we see this code in action, we'll need to link to this javascript file
  in our HTML.
</p>
<h4>hello_vue/index.html</h4>
<pre data-language="html">
    &lt;!-- previous html... --&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id="app"&gt;
    Hello, {{ message }}
    &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;!-- adding this line: --&gt;
        &lt;script src="index.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  Why did we put the script tag inside the body? We need to add it
  <em>after</em> we've imported the Vue framework, and also after we've defined
  the element we'll be applying the code to. Code is read from top to bottom, so
  go ahead and test that line in different places to see if you can get a couple
  of different errors! (Open your browser's console to see the errors.)
