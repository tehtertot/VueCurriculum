<p>Now that we've got all these moving parts, it can feel overwhelming and hard to remember what's what and where. Luckily, other developers have felt the same and developed a really helpful extension called Vue.js devtools. In your preferred browser (either Chrome or Firefox), search the extensions or add-ons for the tool and add it to your browser. (If you see multiple options, a good rule of thumb is to choose the one with the most ratings/downloads.)</p>
<p>Once the extension is downloaded, when your browser detects that a page is using Vue, you should have an additional panel in your browser's DevTools (the options that appear when you inspect a page's element):</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/16-devtools.PNG" alt="devtools menu" style="height: 150px;">
</div>
<p>With your previous assignment open, open the Vue panel and take a look around. Instead of seeing our page in terms of HTML, we can now view it by components. When we click on a given component, we are able to see that component's associated props and data! If you are still a little fuzzy on the difference, take special note of how props and data values differ depending on which component you are analyzing. Moving forward, especially as our applications get more complex and have more components, this will be an invaluable tool for debugging and understanding our code.</p>
