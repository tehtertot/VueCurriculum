<h1>Introduction to Vue.js</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Understand the purpose of front-end frameworks</li>
    <li>Highlight the pros and cons of Vue</li>
    <li>Compare Vue to other popular frameworks</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Now that you know the fundamentals of the web, we're going to learn one of the frameworks that is revolutioning how web applications are being designed and developed. Because you are likely new to the development of web applications, you may take some of this revolution for granted. Think of a shopping or social media site where you scroll to the bottom and new products or stories suddenly appear, or how you can "like" a post and it is immediately reflected. With traditional HTML, we'd have to make a new request and render a new page to show the next section of items, or when you "liked" a post or image, the page would have to refresh and then start back at the top. This leads to a clunky and slow user experience.</p>
<h2>What is a Front-End Framework?</h2>
<p>When you learned jQuery, you started to see how interaction can begin to happen <em>without</em> requiring a full page refresh. While jQuery is certainly still a widely used solution, front-end frameworks provide guidelines for designing and developing the front end of a web application. As the complexity and expectation for front-end responsiveness grows, frameworks fill the need for more structured approaches for more dynamic applications.</p> 
<h2>Why Vue (vs. React or Angular)?</h2>
<p>Vue, React, and Angular each approach the problem differently, but are similar in their overall goal. These <em>front-end frameworks</em> go beyond jQuery by providing a pre-defined structure for managing DOM manipulation.</p>
<p>Because Angular and React are backed by such large companies (Google and Facebook, respectively), Vue is sometimes overshadowed. However, since its release in February 2014, it continues to increase in popularity within the open-source community. A quick look at <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue" target="_blank">Vue on GitHub</a> reveals over 143,000 stars and usage in over 900,000 public GitHub repositories. Much of it boils down to developer preference, but one of the most appealing things about Vue is its quick learning curve. It is very lightweight and clean.</p>
