<p>Now that you know the fundamentals of the web, you get to learn one of the frameworks that is revolutioning how web applications are being designed and developed. Consider a shopping or social media site where you scroll to the bottom, and new products or stories suddenly appear. With traditional HTML, we'd have to make a new request and render a new page to show the next section of items. (Can you think of a site where you have to click "Next" and the whole page re-renders?) When you learned jQuery, you started to see how interaction can begin to happen.</p> 
<p>Vue, React, and Angular each approach the problem differently, but are similar in their overall goal. These <em>front-end frameworks</em> go beyond jQuery by providing a pre-defined structure for managing DOM manipulation.</p>
