<h2>Components</h2>
<p>
  Like in our normal Vue development proces, much of what we deal with on a
  regular basis in `bootstrap-vue` is components. Since pretty much every
  element on the page is liable to be an element in Vue, this should indicate
  that pretty much anything we can think of in `bootstrap-vue` is a component.
  There are some custom directives and a host of classes and properties, but at
  the end of the day, the bulk of our work will be done with components.
</p>
<p>
  Before we start adding components to our app, we need to make an app. Once our
  new app is created, we can run `npm install boostrap-vue boostrap`. This will
  install both the `bootstrap` and the `bootstrap-vue` libraries. Now that we
  have our packages installed, we need to make sure Vue is aware of them and
  ready to use them. Starting in the <code>main.js</code> file, let's add a few
  lines of code.
</p>
<h4>main.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  import Vue from "vue";
  // import bootstrap-vue
  import BootstrapVue from "bootstrap-vue";
  import App from "./App.vue";
  
  // import css files
  import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";
  import "bootstrap-vue/dist/bootstrap-vue.css";
  
  Vue.config.productionTip = false;
  // use bootstrap-vue as Vue middleware
  Vue.use(BootstrapVue);
  
  new Vue({
    render: h => h(App)
  }).$mount("#app");
</pre>
<p>
  Notice that there really isn't that much to it; with just a few additional
  lines of code we're ready to start adding bootstrap components to our app!
  Let's start with something straightforward. The point of this lesson isn't
  architecture so let's just use the <code>HelloWorld.vue</code> file to play
  around with bootstrap elements. Let's start with a simple example from the
  bootstrap-vue website.
</p>
<h4>HelloWorld.vue</h4>
<pre data-language="html">
  &lt;template&gt;
    &lt;div class="hello-world"&gt;
      &lt;b-button&gt;Button&lt;/b-button&gt;
      &lt;b-button variant="danger"&gt;Button&lt;/b-button&gt;
      &lt;b-button variant="success"&gt;Button&lt;/b-button&gt;
      &lt;b-button variant="outline-primary"&gt;Button&lt;/b-button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/template&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  Notice that all bootstrap component names start with <code>b-</code> and end
  with the bootstrap element name. Instead of attaching classes like with
  traditional bootstrap, we're using pre-built components and passing properties
  to them to make things look and feel how we want them. That's really all there
  is to it. Play with some of the documentation on the
  <a href="https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/docs">bootstrap-vue website</a> and see
  what you can make!
