<h2>What is Nuxt?</h2>
<p>
  We've been talking a lot about "frameworks" lately. CSS frameworks, JavaScript
  frameworks, you name it. Well, Nuxt is a Vue framework. It provides a
  pre-built structure for Vue apps as well as support for SSR and some other
  really cool build tools. Nuxt does a ton, and it can take a while to learn all
  the little nuts and bolts, but let's take a look at it from a high level and
  talk about next steps.
</p>
<p>
  So what exactly <em>is</em> a Vue framework? Just as a CSS framework gives us
  a suite of tools that we can use to make our page <em>look</em> a certain way,
  a Vue framework gives us a suite of tools to make our front-end application
  <em>work</em> a certain way. Nuxt comes with out-of-the-box support for some
  of the things that the vue-cli can handle like adding Vuex or vue-router, but
  it also gives us some additional things like a preset file structure and the
  ability to tweak our app into being server-side rendered. In fact, aside from
  some of the more advanced concepts like SSR, most of what Nuxt does should be
  pretty familiar to us at this point. The big difference we'll notice at the
  outset is the folder hierarchy. Let's start by building a project and seeing
  what's new!
</p>
<p>
  First, let's use a new npm feature called npx to create a nuxt application.
  This allows us to use nuxt without installing it globally to our computer
  first. Go ahead and run <code>npx create-nuxt-app my-first-nuxt-app</code>.
  You can select the defaults for the first few prompts, but we'll use
  <code>npm</code> for this example without any css or server frameworks. When
  prompted to choose Nuxt.js modules, press spacebar on the Axios bullet point
  and move along. Don't worry about testing, but definitely choose SSR as your
  rendering mode. Once you've gone through the prompts, you should have a
  fully-formed Nuxt app!
</p>
<p>
  Let's start by looking at the folder hierarchy. Holy moly, that's a lot of
  folders! You can see lots of information about each of the folders
  <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure">here</a>, but we'll
  mostly just focus on the components and the pages folders. Before we move
  ahead, just notice that this structure is set up for us to be using a vuex
  store, components, stylistic layouts, full web pages, and more. Go ahead and
  run <code>npm run dev</code> to get the app up and running!
</p>
<p>
  You can see right from the outset that Nuxt has set up a page very similar to
  the page we'd see if we had used the vue-cli, so how is this page getting
  created? The first place to look is in the pages folder. You can see that the
  code in <code>index.vue</code> is composing what we see when we're looking at
  our site in the browser. There are a few things we'd like you to notice about
  this page:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The page is a Vue component</li>
  <li>
    It can be composed of html attributes or other components, just like any
    other Vue component
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  However, there's something special about pages in Nuxt that is really
  exciting. Any page in Nuxt is automatically added to the built-in Nuxt router.
  Try adding a file called <code>about.vue</code> in the pages folder. Include
  the following code:
</p>
<pre data-language="html">
  &lt;template&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;About&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/template&gt;
  
  &lt;script&gt;
  export default {}
  &lt;/script&gt;  
</pre>
<p>
  Now visit <code>localhost:3000/about</code>. Like magic, our code is displayed
  in the browser! The thing is, this isn't magic, Nuxt is a framework that uses
  the pages folder to create routes <strong>for us</strong>. Don't believe us?
  Check out the documentation
  <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing">here</a>!
</p>
<p>
  Making routes is nice, but that would be pretty useless if we couldn't get to
  the pages we've created. Instead of using <code>router-link</code>, Nuxt
  provides a special component called <code>nuxt-link</code>. Let's try adding a
  Nuxt link to our about page.
</p>
<h4>about.vue</h4>
<pre data-language="html">
  &lt;template&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;About&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;nuxt-link to="/"&gt;Home page&lt;/nuxt-link&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/template&gt;
  
  &lt;script&gt;
  export default {}
  &lt;/script&gt;  
</pre>
<p>
  Try it out! Start at <code>localhost:3000/about</code> and click on the "Home
  page" button. It navigates back to the home page! For some of you, the concept
  of creating individual web pages might just make more intuitive sense than
  composing pages of disparate components as we've been doing. However, most of
  the time, we still want to modify our content based on specific information
  that we're given and we need to use a tactic called "dynamic routing". Dynamic
  routing allows us to render the same overall structure of a page whenever a
  certain url pattern is given, but change the specific content. For instance,
  imagine your Facebook profile. It's obviously similar to everyone else's
  profile, but it's unique to you. Dynamic routes enable us to create something
  similar! Let's see how it's done in Nuxt!
</p>
<p>
  Nuxt makes it pretty simple for us to enable dynamic routes in our app. All we
  need to do is prefix the vue filename with an underscore. That's it. We can
  even define a nested routing structure by making folders in our pages folder.
  You can see this in action in the documentation
  <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing#dynamic-routes">here</a>. Let's
  explore this concept by building a fake profile page using an ID as our
  dynamic information. What we want to be able to do is visit
  <code>localhost:3000/profile/1</code> and render the profile information for a
  user with the id of 1. Let's start by making a profile folder in our pages
  folder. Next, let's make a file called <code>_id.vue</code> inside the profile
  folder. What we'd like to be able to do is grab the information from the url
  and make sure we render the right information on the page. We can do that by
  accessing the route parameters in any of our component's methods. Take a look
  at the following code.
</p>
<h4>profile/_id.vue</h4>
<pre data-language="html">
  &lt;template&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;User {{ id }}'s profile&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/template&gt;
  
  &lt;script&gt;
  export default {
    data() {
      return {
        id: null,
      }
    },
    created() {
      const _id = this.$route.params.id
      this.id = _id
    }
  }
  &lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  Notice that when the component is created, we're getting the id parameter from
  the route and setting it to the id parameter in our data. It's a bit of a
  roundabout way of getting our data from our url, but this is an incredibly
  powerful concept. If we can get the information from our route, then we can
  use that information to get whatever we need from an external server so that
  we can render content that matches what our user requested. This enables us to
  use RESTful architecture and to structure our content in a consistent way
  using Vue so that pages like the Facebook profile look consistent no matter
  whose profile is being requested. This is possible whether we're using Nuxt or
  using standard "vanilla" Vue, but Nuxt makes it really easy to set up routing
  so that it "just works".
</p>
<p>
  Pages are great, but we're really using Nuxt so that we can use SSR. Let's see
  how SSR works in the next lesson!
