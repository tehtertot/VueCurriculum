<h2>What is Nuxt?</h2>
<p>
  We've been talking a lot about "frameworks" lately. CSS frameworks, JavaScript
  frameworks, you name it. Well, Nuxt is a Vue framework. It provides a
  pre-built structure for Vue apps as well as support for SSR and some other
  really cool build tools. Nuxt does a ton, and it can take a while to learn all
  the little nuts and bolts, but let's take a look at it from a high level and
  talk about next steps.
