  <li>Write a simple test suite using just JS and Jest</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Often times, when we're comparing objects in JavaScript like arrays and
  objects, we can't use the simple <code>toBe</code> matcher. We'll instead need
  to use <code>toEqual</code>. This is because objects and arrays are passed by
  reference, not by value. Therefore, comparing two arrays that seem identical,
  won't work because they are technically two <em>separate</em> arrays that
  contain the same values. To get around this, we can use the
  <code>toEqual</code> matcher for comparison.

  Use the steps from the last few lessons along with the
  <code>toEqual</code> matcher to write a solution for the Array: Insert At
