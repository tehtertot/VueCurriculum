<h1>Our First Test - Part 2</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Learn how to separate blocks of tests into sub-suites</li>
  <li>Learn how to test for expected errors</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Our test suite is pretty robust. It's consistently passing when our code is
  active, and consistently failing when our code block is commented out. If we
  changed the function to work a completely different way, it wouldn't matter
  because our tests only care about the input and the output. So we're on the
  right track. But there are times when users (including ourselves) may use our
  function incorrectly, and we need to make sure our function has the desired
  behavior. In our example, we may even be interested in throwing a custom
  error. Don't worry, we won't get too crazy, but there are a couple goals that
  we're targeting here:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Introduce you to throwing your own errors</li>
  <li>
    Introduce you to considering more graceful handling of unexpected data
  </li>
  <li>Introduce you to testing for specific errors</li>
</ul>
<p>
  First, let's break our suite up into two sub-suites. A sub-suite usually
  defines the context for a series of tests. The context in this case is the
  type of data we're given. Let's create a sub-suite for when we're given a
  number, and a sub-suite for when we're given a non-number.
</p>
<h4>sigma.test.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
const { sigma } = require("./sigma");

describe("`sigma(num)`", () => {
  describe("when given a number as an argument", () => {
    // our current tests live here
  });

  describe("when given a non-number as an argument", () => {
    // other tests will go here
  });
});
</pre>
<p>
  Notice how we use additional <code>describe</code> blocks to create
  sub-suites. Other testing frameworks use the alias <code>context</code> to
  define specific context blocks rather than full suites, but the idea is the
  same. What we're doing is organizing our unit tests into logically separated
  categories. This becomes really useful when we start using
  <code>setup</code> and <code>teardown</code> blocks, which allow us to perform
  specific actions before or after each test in a suite or sub-suite.
</p>
<p>
  Before we add any tests to our new sub-suite, let's first run the function
  with a non-number and see how it behaves. Try calling sigma in your
  <code>sigma.js</code> file with <code>undefined</code> as a parameter and
  logging the output. What do you see? What happens with other data types? You
  may have noticed that most of the other inputs return 0. Can you find a
  non-number argument that produces the number 1? This may or may not be
  intended behavior. In this case, we weren't specifically given the requirement
  of handling non-numbers. However, let's go ahead and throw a native JavaScript
  <code>TypeError</code> when we're given a parameter that isn't a number. That
  way, our users won't be misled into thinking that their output is okay if they
  accidentally pass a data type that is different from what they expected. Add
  the following code to the very beginning of your code block.
</p>
<h4>sigma.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
function sigma(num) {
  // insert the following code
  // we can't use instanceof because numbers are primitive types
  if (typeof num !== "number") {
    throw new TypeError("Argument must be a number");
  }

  let sum = 0;
  // omitted for brevity
}
</pre>
<p>
  Now, we can expect to throw an error any time our function receives a
  non-number. So how do we test for it? Unfortunately, testing for errors can be
  a bit tricky because of how JavaScript scope works. We'll also have to learn
  about a new Jasmine matcher called <code>toThrow</code>. In fact, this is a
  great time to talk about Jasmine's matchers.
</p>
<h4>Assertion Engines</h4>
<p>
  Jasmine is what's known as an assertion engine. At its core, it allows us to
  compare two values or watch for some behavior in an expressive way. Both the
  <code>expect</code> function and the <code>toBe</code> function come from
  Jasmine and there are many many more matchers available to us, like
  <code>toThrow</code>! You can see a full list of Jasmine's matchers
  <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/api/3.4/matchers.html">here</a>. Let's see
  <code>toThrow</code> in action!
</p>
<h4>sigma.test.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  describe("`sigma(num)`", () => {
    // omitted for brevity
    describe("when given a non-number as an argument", () => {
      it("throws a TypeError when given `undefined`", () => {
        expect(() => {
          sigma(undefined);
        }).toThrow(TypeError);
      });
    });
  });
</pre>
<p>
  The syntax is a bit difficult to unpack at first. What's happening is that we
  need to pass an anonymous function to the expect function. If we just pass
  <code>sigma(undefined)</code>, the whole test file will stop running because
  it has thrown an error. That's because we ran code that threw an error and
  expected to use that code as a value in a matcher. If we wrap the code that
  will throw an error in an anonymous function, the expect block can find out
  what happened inside the anonymous function without breaking execution. We're
  still chaining <code>toThrow</code> onto our <code>expect</code> function, but
  we're calling <code>sigma</code> from inside an enclosed scope.
</p>
<p>
  We can continue testing our functionality with all the different non-number
  types, but that may be overkill in this case. We should be able to add a few
  cases that we expect to be common and trust JavaScript's typeof keyword to
  work properly. And with that, you should have all the tools you need to build
  your own simple test suite!
