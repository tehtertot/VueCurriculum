<h2>Simulating user behavior</h2>
<p>
  We've learned how to shallowMount a component and create a wrapper, but so far
  we haven't learned enough tools to test our buttons! We're not writing
  end-to-end tests yet, so we can't create a browser and actually simulate a
  button click in the browser, but there is something we can do. In an
  integration/unit test we can simulate a click <em>event</em> on an element and
  see if our click handler does the job it's supposed to do!
</p>
<h3>setup and teardown</h3>
<p>
  So far, it's been pretty easy to just do everything we need to do for a test
  inside the <code>it</code> block. However, now that we're working on more
  complex tests and sub-suites, we might have opportunities to make our lives
  easier by setting up each test in the sub-suite the same way each time. We may
  also find that we subsequently need to run some code after each test so that
  the individual tests are running consistently. This is actually a feature of
  Jasmine, which you can look into
  <a
    href="https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html#section-Setup_and_Teardown"
    >here</a
  >. Let's start by setting up each of our tests for the increment button in the
  same way. What needs to be the same each time? What things need to change?
  Let's take a look at test setup using <code>beforeEach</code>.
</p>
<h4>counter.spec.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
describe("increment button", () => {
  let wrapper;
  beforeEach(() => {
    wrapper = shallowMount(Counter);
  });
  // it blocks start here
});
</pre>
<p>
  First, we're creating a variable called wrapper in the sub-suite's global
  scope, then we're creating a new instance of our Counter component and saving
  it to the wrapper variable. Now, all of our tests can use the wrapper
  variable. If we wanted anything else to happen before each test, we could do
  it in the <code>beforeEach</code>! Let's use <code>.find()</code> to get a
  hold of our increment button by its CSS selector and use
  <code>.trigger()</code> to trigger a click event on it!
</p>
<h4>counter.spec.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
describe("increment button is clicked", () => {
  let wrapper;
  beforeEach(() => {
    wrapper = shallowMount(Counter);
  });

  it("updates the component's data", () => {
    const button = wrapper.find("#increment-button");
    button.trigger("click");
    expect(wrapper.vm.count).toBe(1);
  });
});
</pre>
<p>
  Notice that we're accessing <code>wrapper.vm</code>. This is one of the
  wrapper's
  <a href="https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/api/wrapper/#properties"
    >properties</a
  >
  that we have access to when we create a wrapper. All instance methods and
  properties are exposed on <code>wrapper.vm</code>. Now let's try making a new
  method that tests whether or not our header is updated.
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript">
describe("increment button is clicked", () => {
  let wrapper;
  beforeEach(() => {
    wrapper = shallowMount(Counter);
  });

  it("updates the component's data", () => {
    const button = wrapper.find("#increment-button");
    button.trigger("click");
    expect(wrapper.vm.count).toBe(1);
  });

  it("updates the header text", () => {
    const button = wrapper.find("#increment-button");
    button.trigger("click");
    const header = wrapper.find("h1");
    expect(header.text()).toBe("1");
  });
});
</pre>
<p>
  You might notice that we're copying the same code in both tests. If it's not
  going to change, then we might as well put it in the <code>beforeEach</code>!
  Here's the new version.
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript">
describe("increment button is clicked", () => {
  let wrapper;
  beforeEach(() => {
    wrapper = shallowMount(Counter);
    const button = wrapper.find("#increment-button");
    button.trigger("click");
  });

  it("updates the component's data", () => {
    expect(wrapper.vm.count).toBe(1);
  });

  it("updates the header text", () => {
    const header = wrapper.find("h1");
    expect(header.text()).toBe("1");
  });
});
</pre>
<p>
  This is pretty awesome, but there's a caveat. As the test suite grows, it can
  get harder and harder to find the <code>beforeEach</code> block for any given
  test. Think about the case where your sub-suites are nested multiple levels
  deep and each one has its own <code>beforeEach</code>. This can cause the
  <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/mystery-guest">mystery guest problem</a>.
  There are different philosophies about how to organize a test suite, but you
  may find that the tradeoff of duplicating the code for each unit test is a
  worthy tradeoff so that you can increase readability for your code.
