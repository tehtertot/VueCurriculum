<h1>Testing Components</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Learn how to test a component in a Vue app</li>
  <li>Learn about vue-test-utils</li>
  <li>Understand where testing components fits into the larger architecture</li>
</ul>
<h2>New testing tools</h2>
<p>
  So far, what we've done is written unit tests for JavaScript functions. This
  is really similar to what we would be doing if we were testing some
  functionality in Vue that lived in a service or util file. Usually, those
  files exist to provide functions to the rest of the application that are
  useful, but aren't entirely necessary until the app grows in complexity or
  there is a good reason to put something into its own file (like being able to
  reuse it in multiple components). Now, we'll dive a bit deeper into testing by
  writing our first integration test. The classification here is a bit loose.
  Some people might say that testing a single component is a unit test. We're of
  the opinion that components can be complex with lots of moving parts, and that
  the term "integration test" better describes the reality of testing
  components. That being said, let's take a look at how we can test a component!

  First, we'll need to build an app so that we have some components to test.
  Then, we'll need to learn about some new matchers and tools that Vue makes
  available to us. To start, <a href="">download</a> this simple counter app.
  We've gone through the setup process using the vue command line tools and have
  manually selected unit tests with Jest as an option.
