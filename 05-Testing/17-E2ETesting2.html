<h2>A full test</h2>

  Now that we're running e2e tests, we are able to get access to the full
  application state and use it with its full underlying implementation. That
  means, we can actually control and use the app as a user and check information
  about how our state changes or where our page is routed. To get access to
  things like the store, let's add a few lines to our <code>main.js</code> file.
  Currently, the code looks like this:
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  import Vue from 'vue'
  import App from './App.vue'
  import router from './router'
  import store from './store'
  
  Vue.config.productionTip = false
  
  new Vue({
    router,
    store,
    render: h => h(App)
  }).$mount('#app')
</pre>
<p>Let's change it to look like this:</p>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  import Vue from 'vue';
  import App from './App.vue';
  import router from './router';
  import store from './store';
  
  Vue.config.productionTip = false;
  
  const app = new Vue({
    router,
    store,
    render: h => h(App),
  });
  
  app.$mount('#app');
  
  // the if check ensures that this only happens in testing
  // this is a security concern and should always happen
  if (window.Cypress) {
    window.app = app;
  }
</pre>
<p>
  What we've done is made the global Vue component part of the browser's
  <code>window</code> object. That allows us to access the store and router from
  our Cypress tests. This works because Cypress is acting as the browser and has
  access to anything that is globally accessible in the browser. Unfortunately,
  stubbing our <code>createRandomInteger()</code> function in Cypress is
  incredibly difficult. We don't get easy access to the internals of our
  application. We're using all of the internals of our application as they're
  written, but stubbing dependencies is difficult and not very useful. We need
  to think about e2e tests as though we're a user using the real app. In this
  case, we don't have nearly as much control. Open up the
  <code>tests/e2e/specs/</code> folder to see some e2e tests in action.

  The syntax for Cypress is similar but different. It uses Chai's assertion
  engine behind the scenes instead of Jasmine's. It also heavily uses chaining
  to deal with asynchronicity. This allows us to mix and match between Chai's
  assertions and Cypress's where appropriate. Notice how our tests are testing
  things the user should see and feel. Does the page redirect in real life? Does
  it render the right things? In this case, some of the tests are a bit of a
  stretch, but they're useful to illustrate how Cypress works.
