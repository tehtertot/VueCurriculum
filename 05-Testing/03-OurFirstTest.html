<h1>Our First Test</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Learn about testing frameworks and how they work</li>
  <li>Write your first unit test suite</li>
  <li>
    Understand the difference between a test framework and an assertion library
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Frameworks</h2>
<p>
  In JavaScript there are various "testing frameworks" and "assertion engines"
  we can use to write tests. You may have already heard of Mocha, Chai, Jest,
  Jasmine, or a host of others. They don't all do exactly the same thing in the
  exact same way. But just as Vue and React accomplish the same end-goal.
  Testing frameworks will start to look more and more similar as you gain
  familiarity with them. We'll use Jest for our examples, which is also
  supported by the vue-cli. Jest uses Jasmine as its assertion library behind
  the scenes. We'll get into what that means once we've written our first test
  suite!
</p>
<p>
  It's easiest to understand unit testing in a simple environment before we
  apply its concepts to a Vue application, so let's start by making a simple
  function and using Jest to test it. Let's start by creating a new folder
  anywhere on our computer. We'll call ours "my-first-test" but you can call it
  whatever you want. Now, navigate into the "my-first-test" folder and create a
  file called "sigma.js". We'll use the Sigma algorithm from the Coding Dojo
  algorithm book as the explanation of this algorithm. In this case, the
  algorithm itself is not the focus, so we'll provide you with the code. The
  focus here is the tests. Copy the following code into your
  <code>sigma.js</code> file.
</p>
<h4>sigma.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  function sigma(num) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i <= num; i++) {
      sum +=i;
    }
    return sum;
  }
</pre>
<h2>Our first test suite</h2>
<p>
  Tests are typically organized into chunks called "suites". A suite is a series
  of individual tests, or specs, that test individual assertions about our code.
  Each suite is a logical container for a specific set of tests that all belong
  together, and within each suite we can have any number of tests or even any
  number of "sub-suites", which represent a further denomination within our
  suite. Let's go ahead and initialize npm in this project and install Jest.
  Navigate to your project folder in your command line and run
  <code>npm init -y</code>. Now, let's install the Jest command line tools into
  our project by running <code>npm install -D jest-cli</code>. This will save
  the jest-cli to your development dependencies in your
  <code>package.json</code>. Now update the "scripts" property in your
  <code>package.json</code> to look like this:
</p>
<h4>package.json</h4>
<pre data-language="json">
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest --watch"
  },
</pre>
<p>
  This tells npm that when you run <code>npm run test</code>, it should run
  <code>jest --watch</code>, which will run all of our tests automatically! Now,
  let's create a file called <code>sigma.test.js</code> and add a suite with one
  test using the following code.
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  describe('`sigma(num)`', () => {
    it('runs this test!', () => {
      expect(true).toBe(true);
    });
  });
</pre>
<p>
  The <code>describe</code> function tells Jest that this is a new suite. Notice
  that the <code>describe</code> function takes two parameters: a string and a
  function. The string is for us, the developer. It will make it easier to read
  what's happening when we run our tests. The function is defining what the
  suite will do! The <code>it</code> function is very similar to the
  <code>describe</code> function in that it takes a string as a parameter that
  will be used to describe it for the end user, and a function to define what it
  does. Finally, the <code>expect</code> function is what's known as our
  "assertion". The assertion is what we're actually testing. It takes a value,
  and using chaining, we can use any of Jasmine's "assertion matchers" to ask
  questions about that value. In this case, we're just expecting
  <code>true</code> to be equal to <code>true</code>. It's important to know
  that while this all looks like English, the code under the hood is all just
  code. Take a moment to think about how you yourself would write each of the
  functions you see here or how they might actually work!
</p>
<p>Now, let's get to writing some real tests!</p>
