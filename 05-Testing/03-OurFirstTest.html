  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Frameworks</h2>
<p>
  In JavaScript there are various "testing frameworks" and "assertion engines"
  we can use to write tests. You may have already heard of Mocha, Chai, Jest,
  Jasmine, or a host of others. They don't all do exactly the same thing in the
  exact same way. But just as Vue and React accomplish the same end-goal.
  Testing frameworks will start to look more and more similar as you gain
  familiarity with them. We'll use Jest for our examples, which is also
  supported by the vue-cli. Jest uses Jasmine as its assertion library behind
  the scenes. We'll get into what that means once we've written our first test
  suite!
</p>
<p>
  It's easiest to understand unit testing in a simple environment before we
  apply its concepts to a Vue application, so let's start by making a simple
  function and using Jest to test it. Let's start by creating a new folder
  anywhere on our computer. We'll call ours "my-first-test" but you can call it
  whatever you want. Now, navigate into the "my-first-test" folder and create a
  file called "sigma.js". We'll use the Sigma algorithm from the Coding Dojo
  algorithm book as the explanation of this algorithm. In this case, the
  algorithm itself is not the focus, so we'll provide you with the code. The
  focus here is the tests. Copy the following code into your
  <code>sigma.js</code> file.
</p>
<h4>sigma.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  function sigma(num) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i <= num; i++) {
      sum +=i;
    }
    return sum;
  }
</pre>
<h2>Our first test suite</h2>
<p>
  Tests are typically organized into chunks called "suites". A suite is a series
  of individual tests, or specs, that test individual assertions about our code.
  Each suite is a logical container for a specific set of tests that all belong
  together, and within each suite we can have any number of tests or even any
  number of "sub-suites", which represent a further denomination within our
  suite. Let's go ahead and initialize npm in this project and install Jest.
  Navigate to your project folder in your command line and run
  <code>npm init -y</code>. Now, let's install the Jest command line tools into
  our project by running <code>npm install -D jest-cli</code>. This will save
  the jest-cli to your development dependencies in your
  <code>package.json</code>. Now update the "scripts" property in your
  <code>package.json</code> to look like this:
</p>
<h4>package.json</h4>
<pre data-language="json">
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest --watch"
  },
</pre>
<p>
  This tells npm that when you run <code>npm run test</code>, it should run
  <code>jest --watch</code>, which will run all of our tests automatically! Now,
  let's create a file called <code>sigma.test.js</code> and add a suite with one
  test using the following code.
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  describe('`sigma(num)`', () => {
    it('runs this test!', () => {
      expect(true).toBe(true);
    });
  });
</pre>
<p>
  The <code>describe</code> function tells Jest that this is a new suite. Notice
  that the <code>describe</code> function takes two parameters: a string and a
  function. The string is for us, the developer. It will make it easier to read
  what's happening when we run our tests. The function is defining what the
  suite will do! The <code>it</code> function is very similar to the
  <code>describe</code> function in that it takes a string as a parameter that
  will be used to describe it for the end user, and a function to define what it
  does. Finally, the <code>expect</code> function is what's known as our
  "assertion". The assertion is what we're actually testing. It takes a value,
  and using chaining, we can use any of Jasmine's "assertion matchers" to ask
  questions about that value. In this case, we're just expecting
  <code>true</code> to be equal to <code>true</code>. It's important to know
  that while this all looks like English, the code under the hood is all just
  code. Take a moment to think about how you yourself would write each of the
  functions you see here or how they might actually work!
</p>
<p>
  Now, let's get to writing some real tests! When we start writing tests, it's
  important to think about all the possible ways your code could be used. In
  this case, the obvious case is when we're given a positive number to count up
  to, we should return the sum of all the numbers from 1 to that number. Let's
  write a test that will test whether or not our function does that. First,
  we'll need to take a few steps to import our function into our test file.
  Unfortunately, we're not going to be able to use the same import/export syntax
  that we're familiar with in Vue, but when we start testing Vue that will
  change. Go ahead and copy the syntax below.
</p>
<h4>sigma.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  function sigma(num) {
    // unchanged...
  }

  module.exports = {
    sigma
  }
</pre>
<h4>sigma.test.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  const sigma = require("./sigma").sigma;
  //the rest is unchanged...
  describe('`sigma(num)`', () => {
</pre>
<p>
  What we've done here is used the "old" way of exporting and importing in a
  node-based environment. We're exporting an object from the
  <code>sigma.js</code> file that has a key called sigma that stores the sigma
  function. Then, we're importing that function and saving it into a variable
  called sigma. Now that that's out of the way, let's compose our test.
</p>
<h4>sigma.test.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  it("returns the sum of 1 to n when given a positive number", () => {
    const result = sigma(5);
    expect(result).toBe(15);
  });
</pre>
<p>
  In this simple example, the number that we're using to test the sigma function
  is irrelevant as long as it's positive and doesn't clash with any of our other
  tests. If you run <code>npm run test</code>, you should see all your tests
  pass! If we were truly following the principles of TDD, we'd write our tests
  <em>first</em> before we write our function. Let's try commenting out the code
  inside our sigma function and saving the file. Did you see your tests fail?
  Notice how Jest is running our tests and telling us exactly which tests passed
  and failed. This is why the strings we pass to the <code>describe</code> and
  <code>it</code> functions are important. They help us understand what's going
  right and what's going wrong. Typically, our <code>it</code> blocks are
  phrased along the lines of "this outcome is expected with this set of
  inputs/criteria". Our <code>describe</code> blocks will help us specify groups
  of tests that make sense together. Let's add a few more tests to see this in
  action.
</p>
<p>
  So far, we're testing the basic use case for this function, but what about if
  someone tries to pass a negative number? What about 0? What if someone passes
  a string or an object? First, we need to know what we <em>want</em> to happen.
  Then we can test it. Try writing tests for the other cases involving numbers
  on your own and peek below to see our version.
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  describe("`sigma(num)`", () => {
    it("returns the sum of 1 to n when given a positive number", () => {
      const result = sigma(5);
      expect(result).toBe(15);
    });
  
    it("returns 0 when given 0", () => {
      expect(sigma(0)).toBe(0);
    });
  
    it("returns 0 when given a negative number", () => {
      expect(sigma(-2)).toBe(0);
    });
  });
</pre>
<p>
  Notice that we changed up our syntax slightly for the next two tests. There's
  no real need to save the result of the sigma function in a variable if we
  don't want to. You can use whatever you're comfortable with. Let's handle the
  cases where we're given an unexpected data type in the next lesson!
