<h2>Mocking function implementation</h2>
<p>
  We've been talking about it for a few lessons now, so let's finally mock our
  implementation for our <code>createRandomInteger</code> function. First, we
  have to understand how our method works. If we click on the "heads" button,
  we'll compare the static number 0 to a random number that comes from
  <code>createRandomInteger</code>. If that generated number is a 0, we'll have
  won the game; if that number is a 1, we lose. What we want to do is make our
  function either always return 1 or always return 0. Essentially, this is
  testing the case in which the coin flip was a "heads" or a "tails". We know
  that our user selected "heads" in this example, so if we can control the flip,
  we should be able to test how our function reacts to that information. Jest
  has a really neat feature where we can pass a callback function to the mock
  and mock the actual <em>implementation details</em> of the function. In this
  case, it doesn't matter how the <code>createRandomInteger</code> function
  actually works. We just need it to return 1 or 0. Let's see how that works.

<pre data-language="javascript">
import { shallowMount, createLocalVue } from '@vue/test-utils';
import Home from '@/views/Home.vue';
import Vuex from 'vuex';
import * as flipUtils from '@/utils/flip-utils';

const localVue = createLocalVue();
localVue.use(Vuex);
const store = new Vuex.Store();
store.commit = jest.fn();

describe('Home.vue', () => {
  afterEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks();
  });

  describe('user chooses heads', () => {
    it('calls `store.commit("incrementWins")` when the flip is a "heads"', () => {
      flipUtils.createRandomInteger = jest.fn(() => 0);
      const wrapper = shallowMount(Home, {
        localVue,
        store,
        mocks: {
          $router: {
            push: jest.fn(),
          },
        },
      });

      wrapper.find('#heads-button').trigger('click');
      expect(store.commit).toHaveBeenCalledWith('incrementWins');
    });
  });
});
</pre>
<p>
  Notice here that we're importing our <code>createRandomInteger</code> function
  using a different kind of import. If we were to import this function using our
  destructuring syntax that we're accustomed to, we wouldn't be able to mock it.
  Our interpreter would tell us that it's a read-only value. What we've done
  here to get around the issue is import the entire file 'flip-utils.js' and
  give it the alias <code>flipUtils</code>. This exports every exported function
  as a key inside an object called <code>flipUtils</code>. We can overwrite
  those keys at-will. Look at the first line of our unit test. We're overwriting
  our <code>createRandomInteger</code> function with a mock. Our mock is a
  function that just returns 0, mimicking a "heads" flip. Now we can assert what
  should happen in our store when a user picks "heads" and a "heads" is flipped!
