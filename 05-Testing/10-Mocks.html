<h2>Mocking</h2>
<p>
  The following example will use a demo app that can be downloaded
  <a href="">here</a>. Take a moment to get acclimated with the application by
  running it locally. Also, take some time to look at the code to really
  understand what's going on. If you have any questions about how the app works,
  be sure to ask your classmates first, then talk to your instructor.
</p>
<p>
  We'll eventually end up testing every feature of this app end-to-end, but the
  easiest way to illustrate mocks is by testing the
  <code>makeChoice</code> function in the "home" view. Notice how it takes a
  choice, 'heads' or 'tails', turns the choice into either 0 or 1, and compares
  that to a random integer. Now let's look at the
  <code>createRandomInteger()</code> function in
  <code>src/utils/flip-utils</code>. This is a helper function that randomly
  returns either 0 or 1. Since we're using JavaScript's built-in Math library
  and generating something randomly, it's incredibly hard to test. First of all,
  we'd basically just be testing whether or not JavaScript does what it's
  supposed to do. Second of all, testing whether or not something is 0 or 1
  isn't useful because it's true even if the number is always one or the other.
  Additionally, our <code>makeChoice</code> function relies on the
  <code>createRandomInteger</code> function in order for it to do its job. This
  is really problematic because we can't ever predict what the result of
  <code>createRandomInteger</code> will be!
</p>
<p>
  Now that we know the problem, we need a solution. We mentioned in the last
  lesson that we can use stubs and spies, and this is a perfect opportunity to
  use both! Let's first make sure that when we simulate a click on the heads or
  tails buttons that the <code>makeChoice</code> function gets called. This will
  give us some practice with mocks!
</p>
<h4>home.spec.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  import { shallowMount } from '@vue/test-utils';
  import Home from '@/views/Home.vue';
  
  describe('Home.vue', () => {
    describe('user chooses heads', () => {
      it('calls `makeChoice()`', () => {
        const makeChoiceMock = jest.fn();
        
        const wrapper = shallowMount(Home, {
          methods: {
            makeChoice: makeChoiceMock,
          },
        });
        
        wrapper.find('#heads-button').trigger('click');
        expect(makeChoiceMock.mock.calls.length).toBe(1);
      });
    });
  });
</pre>
<p>
  The first thing you should notice is the variable <code>makeChoiceMock</code>.
  It's just a normal variable that's storing something special. It's storing one
  of Jest's "mock functions". A mock function will keep track of how many times
  it was called and what arguments were used when calling it. Next, notice that
  we're using our <code>shallowMount</code> but with options now. The options
  allow us to do all sorts of things like set initial properties, mock methods,
  stub slots, and more. Basically, the options for the component allow us to
  control, like with mocks, the initial inputs for our components so that we can
  test how they behave in different circumstances. Read about all the options
  <a href="https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/api/options.html">here</a>. Finally,
  we're simulating a click and seeing whether or not the mock function was ever
  called. We can do this because Jest mock functions store a special property
  called <code>mock</code> that gives us a bunch of useful information. Check
  out what the mock object gives us
  <a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-function-api.html">here</a>!
</p>
<p>
  The issue with this test is that we're pretty much just testing whether or not
  Vue's click handler works. If <code>makeChoice()</code> is supposed to be
  called on each <code>click</code>, we should expect that to happen because
  it's built right into Vue. So what would be a more useful test? What if we
  could test something that is unique to our particular app? In this case, it
  would be useful if we could ensure that the <code>makeChoice()</code> function
  is being passed the string <code>"heads"</code>. Let's modify our test a bit.
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  it('calls `makeChoice()` with "heads"', () => {
    const makeChoiceMock = jest.fn();

    const wrapper = shallowMount(Home, {
      methods: {
        makeChoice: makeChoiceMock,
      },
    });

    wrapper.find('#heads-button').trigger('click');
    expect(makeChoiceMock.mock.calls[0][0]).toBe('heads');
  });
</pre>
<p>
  Notice that we've only changed one section. See how the
  <code>mock</code> property has its own property <code>calls</code>. Calls is
  an array of arrays. The outer array holds an index for each time the function
  was called. Each index is another array, whose indices are arguments. This is
  what our <code>calls</code> array may look like after a few calls:
  <code>[['heads'], ['tails'], ['heads'], ['heads']]</code>. So, if we know that
  we have one call, with one argument, we can use
  <code>makeChoiceMock.mock.calls[0][0]</code> to find the first argument of the
  first call of our mock function. Luckily, we have access to some helpful
  matchers that can give us some more expressive terms. Check this out! Read up
  about more Jasmine matchers
  <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/api/3.4/matchers">here</a>.
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  it('calls `makeChoice()` with "heads"', () => {
    const makeChoiceMock = jest.fn();

    const wrapper = shallowMount(Home, {
      methods: {
        makeChoice: makeChoiceMock,
      },
    });

    wrapper.find('#heads-button').trigger('click');
    expect(makeChoiceMock).toHaveBeenCalledWith('heads');
  });
</pre>
<h4>A Note:</h4>
<p>
  It's important to note here that the <code>makeChoice()</code> method in our
  component has been <em>overwritten</em>. If we had just mounted without
  options, we wouldn't have been able to tell whether or not
  <code>makeChoice</code> had been called directly. But what we did was we
  replaced the method in our component with the method in our
  <code>shallowMount</code> function. We replaced it with our mock function. In
  this way, we've stubbed the method, because it doesn't do what it did
  initially. However, combined with other tests that don't replace
  <code>makeChoice()</code>, we can test various facets of the functionality,
  including how the original <code>makeChoice()</code> function actually works.
  Let's try another example. Wouldn't it be nice if we could test that our
  <code>makeChoice()</code> function works depending on what our result is from
  <code>createRandomInteger()</code>? To do that, we'll need to learn how to
  mock routes and vuex. But first, let's get some practice adding mocks to our
  test suite.
