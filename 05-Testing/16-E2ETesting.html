<h1>E2E Testing</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Learn about the philosophy behind e2e testing and how to implement basic
    tests
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p>
  Ideally, your application's tests should look like a pyramid. Unit tests
  should be by far the most prevalent and live at the bottom, followed by
  integration tests and finally e2e tests. End-to-end tests, or e2e tests test
  an application from the user's perspective. They open a browser window, click
  buttons like a user, can take screenshots, and otherwise do whatever a user
  can do. At first glance, it might seem like this is the way to write every
  test. Why not just test the app the way the user would have to use it?
</p>
<p>
  e2e tests are much, much more fragile than unit or integration tests because
  the app's functionality, look, or structure can often change. When we change
  some core feature or responsibility for our app, unit tests tend to be less
  likely to break because they test every little feature in isolation. For
  instance, if we change how our <code>generateRandomInteger</code> function
  works behind-the-scenes, it doesn't matter because we only care that it
  returns a 0 or a 1 (in the coin change example). e2e tests on the other hand
  are specifically reliant on the end-result product of html, css, and js that
  is eventually bundled and sent to the browser. What if we were testing whether
  or not our app's title was listed in an <code>h1</code> tag on the page and we
  wanted to change the name of the app from "Coin Flip" to "Flip Coins"? We'd
  have to go change all of our e2e tests that test that specific content!
  Furthermore, most of our app's functionality, especially in the case of our
  simple coin-flip app can be easily and reliably tested using unit or
  integration tests.
</p>
<p>
  For the reasons listed above, and based on industry standard practices, we
  recommend that you only implement e2e tests for things that you cannot
  otherwise test in unit or integration tests. Additionally, you may add e2e
  tests to your project to test absolutely critical pieces of your application
  that must pass before release. However, it is usually useful to trust your
  unit and integration tests.
</p>
<h2>Frameworks</h2>
<p>
  Just as with everything in software, e2e testing has its popular frameworks
  and the Vue community has its favorites. The old industry standard chrome
  driver is called Selenium. It can be used to create a new chrome browser and
  operate it as a user in many different programming languages. Many frameworks
  wrap around selenium to provide additional functionality. Vue recommends a
  selenium framework called Nightwatch as a primary option for e2e testing.
  However, the Vue community has also selected a second favorite: Cypress.
  Cypress is an e2e test framework that doesn't use Selenium. Its API is easier
  to understand and get started with and it has some compelling new features.
  Vue CLI supports both, but we've selected Cypress for our framework. You can
  read the documentation
  <a
    href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html#In-a-nutshell"
    >here</a
  >.
</p>
<h2>Our First Test</h2>
<p>
  Since we used the Vue CLI to create an app with Cypress preinstalled, you'll
  notice a folder called e2e in the coin-flip project. Notice that the syntax is
  eerily similar to Jest and vue-test-utils. Let's see a simple test in action.
</p>
<h4>tests/e2e/specs/home.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
describe('Home', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.visit('/');
  });

  it('contains a header with the name of the app', () => {
    cy.contains('h1', 'Coin Flip');
  });
});
</pre>
<p>
  Run <code>npm run test:e2e</code>. Notice that Cypress has opened up an
  interactive test window. We can click "Run all specs" in the top right corner
  of the new window, or we can just click on the file we want to test. Try
  clicking on the file "home.js" in the Cypress window to see what happens.
</p>
<p>
  This functionality is actually pretty cool. It opens up our app in a new
  chrome browser, runs the test, and shows us the state it's in when it
  finishes. It gives us a live feed of what the test is seeing and doing. While
  this is awesome, it can be a bit cumbersome to do this process by hand each
  time we want to run our tests. Let's edit our package.json to change our
  default script to run all the tests automatically. You can also quit Cypress
  by typing <code>ctrl + c</code> in your command line window. The following
  snippet has been edited for brevity, please edit only the
  <code>scripts/test:e2e</code> key in your <code>package.json</code>.
</p>
<h4>package.json</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  {
    "scripts": {
      "test:e2e": "vue-cli-service test:e2e --headless"
    }
  }
</pre>
<p>
  The <code>--headless</code> flag will run all of our tests without opening the
  Cypress window. We can always remove it for debugging, but running the e2e
  tests headlessly is usually sufficient and typically quicker. Go ahead and
  make your own call on which you prefer.
