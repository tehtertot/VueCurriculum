<h2>Continuous Integration/Deployment</h2>
<p>
  If you hang around developers for long enough, you're bound to hear about
  CI/CD. Those acronyms stand for "Continuous Integration" and "Continuous
  Deployment". Before we can really dive into either, let's talk about some
  additional tools in the development ecosystem that we could potentially
  leverage.
</p>
<p>
  CI/CD tools allow us to hook into our code development lifecycle (usually
  using git) and run a suite of automated tasks before certain actions occur.
  For instance, before we merge a feature branch into our master branch, let's
  make sure all of our tests pass. CI/CD tools usually allow us to specify a
  "build environment" for the tests to run in that mimics the environment the
  application will be running on when it's out in the wild and they are commonly
  used to run tests and do other tasks that allow us to see if our app is
  running properly. They can also automate tasks like deploying our app onto our
  staging or production servers and any number of things that can be done using
  the command-line. The idea here is that we should be able to write code, test
  it, and ship it confidently. Once that code is in our project's repository, it
  should check itself for flaws and get pushed live as soon as we know it's all
  safe.
</p>
<p>
  In practice CI/CD can be pretty involved, but some common tools are
  <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a> and
  <a href="https://circleci.com/">Circle CI</a>. Each of these tools essentially
  performs the same job, and it will link into your repository. It's worth
  diving into CI/CD concepts in the future and taking a look at each
  competitor's website is a good idea, but we're not going to get into the weeds
  during this course.
</p>
<h2>CI vs CD</h2>
<p>
  Last, we'd like to fully unpack exactly what CI and CD mean. CI is the process
  of running all automated tests and processes on a particular development
  branch so that you and your team can confidently merge the latest code into
  the application's master code without worrying too much about whether or not
  it works (this is why good tests are so important). CD means that after a
  certain action happens - usually pulling a certain feature branch into the
  master branch - the code should automatically deploy itself to production and
  be live for all users.
</p>
<p>
  If we automate these processes, it allows our development process to be much
  simpler. We can spend more time focusing on writing and fixing features and
  less time worrying about whether or not our feature made it into the
  production application properly. They are massively helpful tools. Once you're
  comfortable with Vue, CI/CD should be on your list to learn about once you
  begin to tackle new projects of your own.
