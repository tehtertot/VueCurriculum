<h2>Mocking Global Functions</h2>
<p>
  Our method is a complicated one because it calls upon both vuex and
  vue-router. It also uses an external function that we wrote called
  'createRandomInteger'. If we want to really test the functionality of our
  <code>makeChoiceMock()</code> function, we have to make sure all of our
  dependencies are stubbed. Let's take a look at what needs to be stubbed:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>createRandomInteger</code></li>
  <li><code>this.$store.commit()</code></li>
  <li><code>this.$router.push()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Each of these pieces has a unique way that it needs to be stubbed, and
  unfortunately, we're not going to be able to test them out until we fully stub
  all of them. But why do these need to be stubbed? Can't we just run our code
  using <code>shallowMount</code> and let Vue do its thing? Unfortunately, no.
  Global modules/functions are special cases because
  <code>vue-test-utils</code> doesn't import things like Vuex and Vue Router by
  design. This does a few things for us: it makes us think about how we actually
  need to implement the global dependencies we're using and it prevents our unit
  tests from importing unnecessary modules that would cause bloat and generally
  add confusion to our tests. For functions like
  <code>createRandomInteger</code>, we still want to mock the functionality, but
  it will work as-is if we leave it to its own devices.
</p>
<h3>localVue</h3>
<p>
  If we want to test Vuex and Vue Router, we'll need to learn about a feature of
  vue-test-utils called <code>createLocalVue</code>. The documentation says:
  "createLocalVue returns a Vue class for you to add components, mixins and
  install plugins without polluting the global Vue class". That sounds fine, but
  what does it mean? <code>createLocalVue</code> allows us to use global
  packages that are installed as plugins using <code>Vue.use()</code> without
  having to use the real router or real Vue instance that we're using globally
  for our app. This keeps our tests isolated and ensures that our unit tests are
  self-contained. We're also given a <code>mocks</code> option in our mounting
  options object that we can use. We can see both demonstrated below. We'll be
  testing Vuex with option 1 and Vue Router with option 2 and break them down
  individually into their respective parts.
</p>
<h4>Vue Router Test</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
import { shallowMount, createLocalVue } from '@vue/test-utils';
import Home from '@/views/Home.vue';
import Vuex from 'vuex';

const localVue = createLocalVue();
localVue.use(Vuex);
const store = new Vuex.Store();
store.commit = jest.fn();

describe('Home.vue', () => {
  describe('user chooses heads', () => {
    it('calls `router.push()` with argument: "/results"', () => {
      const pushMock = jest.fn();

      const wrapper = shallowMount(Home, {
        localVue,
        store,
        mocks: {
          $router: {
            push: pushMock,
          },
        },
      });

      wrapper.find('#heads-button').trigger('click');
      expect(pushMock).toHaveBeenCalledWith('/results');
    });
  });
});
</pre>
<p>
  First, it's important to note that for our test to even work we need to mock
  both Vue Router and Vuex, so to test Vue Router, we have to include the mocks
  for Vuex. That being said, let's just focus on the router mock for now. Notice
  how the only thing we have to do to use the <code>mocks</code> option is
  provide an object. The object passed to <code>mocks</code> will be attached to
  the component instance directly. Basically, that means we're overwriting
  properties on the component's <code>this</code>. Here, we're overwriting
  <code>$router</code> with an object and setting <code>push</code> to be a
  mocked function in that object. Now, when our method calls
  <code>this.$router.push</code>, it'll actually just call our mock function,
  which in this case is called <code>pushMock</code>! Now we're testing that our
  function redirects to the new view once someone clicks on the button. Cool!
  Now let's make sure that our method commits the correct mutation whether the
  user wins or loses the game.
</p>
<p>
  Let's break this up into a few steps. First, let's make sure we can see what
  our vuex store is doing, then let's make sure that we can control the
  environment so we can isolate wins and losses.
</p>
<h4>Working with commit</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  import { shallowMount, createLocalVue } from '@vue/test-utils';
import Home from '@/views/Home.vue';
import Vuex from 'vuex';

const localVue = createLocalVue();
localVue.use(Vuex);
const store = new Vuex.Store();
store.commit = jest.fn();

describe('Home.vue', () => {
  describe('user chooses heads', () => {
    it('calls `store.commit()`', () => {
      const wrapper = shallowMount(Home, {
        localVue,
        store,
        mocks: {
          $router: {
            push: jest.fn(),
          },
        },
      });

      wrapper.find('#heads-button').trigger('click');
      console.log(store.commit.mock.calls);
      expect(store.commit).toHaveBeenCalled();
    });
  });
});
</pre>
<p>Let's start at the very top of the file. Notice that we're:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Importing Vuex</li>
  <li>
    Creating a variable called localVue and storing a new test Vue instance in
    it
  </li>
  <li>
    Creating a new instance of a vuex store and saving it in a variable called
    store
  </li>
  <li>Overwriting store.commit with a mock function</li>
  <li>
    Adding <code>localVue</code> and <code>store</code> to our mounting options
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  All of this is necessary to get this mock to work. It seems like more work,
  and it is, but the advantage is that we have an actual Vuex instance created
  in an actual test Vue instance. That means we have access to all the stuff
  Vuex can do without having to write it all by hand like we did in the mocks
  object. This isn't incredibly useful in this case, but it can be an advantage
  to using this approach. We're adding localVue and store globally in the
  mounting options object. <code>localVue</code> is actually an official
  mounting option in vue-test-utils, so as long as our instance has the same
  name, it can be used in the <code>localVue</code> key in our mounting options
  as we've done above. We also want the store to be global to mimic how it works
  in the real app, so we're doing the same thing with our store. Notice that our
  store is empty. While we could fill it with all of our store objects, in this
  case we don't need to. We really only want to check that we're calling the
  right mutation, so if we overwrite <code>commit</code>, we can check what
  arguments it was called with and not worry about the mutations themselves.
  Also notice that we have a <code>console.log</code> statement. If you look at
  the output you'll see something like
  <code>[ [ 'incrementWins' ], [ 'incrementLosses' ] ]</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Why is this function being called twice? And why does the output keep
  changing? Since we're mocking the Vuex store globally instead of in a
  <code>beforeEach</code>, <code>store.commit</code> is always the same exact
  instance of a function in each test. It doesn't get overwritten. It's always
  there. That's an issue, because our mock holds on to information that our
  individual tests aren't prepared for. We could fix this issue by putting the
  function in a <code>beforeEach</code>, which would create an entirely new mock
  each time. We could also use a teardown block called <code>afterEach</code>.
  We're going to do the latter because we want to expose you to some additional
  considerations with Jest mocks as well as a use-case for the
  <code>afterEach</code> block. Let's add the <code>afterEach</code> block to
  our suite so we can ensure our mock gets cleared after each test, ensuring
  that we have an entirely controlled mock function.
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript">
import { shallowMount, createLocalVue } from '@vue/test-utils';
import Home from '@/views/Home.vue';
import Vuex from 'vuex';

const localVue = createLocalVue();
localVue.use(Vuex);
const store = new Vuex.Store();
store.commit = jest.fn();

describe('Home.vue', () => {
  afterEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks();
  });

  describe('user chooses heads', () => {
    it('calls `store.commit()`', () => {
      const wrapper = shallowMount(Home, {
        localVue,
        store,
        mocks: {
          $router: {
            push: jest.fn(),
          },
        },
      });

      wrapper.find('#heads-button').trigger('click');
      console.log(store.commit.mock.calls);
      expect(store.commit).toHaveBeenCalled();
    });
  });
});
</pre>
<p>
  What we're doing here is ensuring that all of our mocked functions get
  completely reset after each test. You can read more about some of the options
  <a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/en/jest-object#jestclearallmocks">here</a>.
  Notice that our <code>afterEach</code>, much like a <code>beforeEach</code>,
  will apply to all the tests within the scope where it is defined. That means
  this <code>afterEach</code> will apply to every unit test. We can nest our
  setup and teardown logic for more granular control if necessary, just be
  careful not to make your logic too convoluted. Now that we have full control
  over our test mocks. Let's finally get into how we'll test wins and losses in
  the next lesson!
