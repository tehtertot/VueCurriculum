  Mutations are the de facto way to mutate state in Vuex. But sometimes they
  just can't do the job. We're going to deal with asynchronicity in the next
  chapter, but let's talk about what Vuex actions do and why we might use them
  in theory.
</p>
<h2>Asynchronicity</h2>
<p>
  The key reason we need Vuex actions is to deal with asynchronous code. For
  one, all mutations <em>must</em> be synchronous, or we'll start losing the
  ability to debug our application using our devtools (more on that later). But
  what does that really mean?
</p>
<p>
  Synchronous code is code that will start and finish at a predictable point in
  time. All the code we've dealt with so far has been synchronous. When we
  commit a mutation, it mutates state directly and then it's done. We know that
  that mutation will happen right when we call it and before anything else
  happens. However, there are various reasons code may be asynchronous,
  especially in JavaScript. One reason might be that we have a list of thousands
  of movies in a database somewhere, but it's not stored directly in our Vue
  app. We'll need to request that information from a server somewhere and we
  have no idea when that information will return to us. In that case, we'll need
  to rely on actions.
</p>
<p>Let's see an action in action in a contrived example.</p>
<h4>main.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  const store = new Vuex.Store({
    // ...state
    mutations: {
      arbitraryMutation() {
        // some code
      },
    },
    actions: {
      async arbitraryAction(context) {
        const somethingWeAreWaitingFor = await getStuffFromDatabases();
        context.commit('arbitraryMutation');
      }
    }
  })
</pre>
<p>
  Obviously this isn't a very realistic example but the important thing is that
  we can use actions to wait for certain things to happen, especially useful for
  when we have to interact with an external server, and then we can commit
  mutations synchronously. Just remember that Vuex actions are really useful
  when:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You need to commit multiple different mutations at once</li>
  <li>
    You need to do something asynchronous, like code that interacts with an
    external server
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Take a look at the documentation
  <a href="https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/actions.html">here</a> and see what you
  can gather. We'll be using actions in the next section.
