<h1>Vuex Getters</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Learn about state and Vuex getters</li>
  <li>Learn about when and how to use Vuex getters</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Now that we know about derived state and computed properties, we can properly
  dive into the power of Vuex's getters. Vuex getters are computed properties,
  but they're stored in the Vuex store, rather than being computed in each
  individual component. We're still deriving some state from the raw state
  object, but we have global access to said state from all components. There are
  a few huge benefits to this pattern. Firstly, if more than one component uses
  the same computed style, we can reuse it (remember how Vue components are
  supposed to be reusable?). Second, it allows us to store all of our state
  management "logic" in one concise location. When we are dealing with state, we
  can put all that code in the store.
</p>
<h2>Getters in action</h2>
<p>
  Okay so we know what getters do, but how do we use them? Let's take a look at
  an example. Using the same movie app project from before, we can greatly
  simplify our application by rewriting our computed properties as getters.
  Eventually, we'd like to get to the point where we don't need separate
  components for <code>ComedyMovieList</code> and
  <code>FamilyMovieList</code> so we can write just one component,
  <code>MovieList</code> and reuse it. This is a great example of refactoring
  that we mentioned in previous chapters. It might not always be immediately
  obvious how we would reuse a component, but now that we know it's possible,
  let's solve the problem of making it happen. To start, let's examine our new
  desired component structure:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>App</li>
  <li>MovieList</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This is a powerful step in our journey because we can now imagine that there
  are more genres for movies in our state like "Horror", "Thriller", and
  "Romantic Comedy". We can use the same MovieList component for all of the
  genres without doing any additional work!
</p>
<p>
  For our first step, let's rewrite our app to use two distinct getters: one for
  comdies and the other for family movies.
</p>
<h4>main.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
const store = new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    movies: [
      { id: 1, title: 'The Hangover', genre: 'Comedy' },
      { id: 2, title: 'I Love You Man', genre: 'Comedy' },
      { id: 3, title: 'Cars', genre: 'Family' },
      { id: 4, title: 'Toy Story', genre: 'Family' },
    ],
  },
  getters: {
    comedyMovies(store) {
      return store.movies.filter(movie => movie.genre === 'Comedy');
    },
    familyMovies(store) {
      return store.movies.filter(movie => movie.genre === 'Family');
    },
  },
});
</pre>
<p>
  Notice the new property in our store called "getters". This is where we can
  set up our global computed properties and export them to the rest of the Vue
  app. Now let's look at how we can make MovieList its own component.
</p>
<h4>MovieList.vue--html</h4>
<pre data-language="html">
  &lt;template&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;{{ genre }}&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li v-for="movie in movies" :key="movie.id"&gt;{{
    movie.title
  }}&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/template&gt;
</pre>
<h4>MovieList.vue--script</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  export default {
    name: "FamilyMovieList",
    props: {
      genre: String,
      movies: Array
    }
  };
</pre>
<p>
  There are a few things you should notice. First, notice how little our actual
  list has changed. All we did was change 'comedyMovies' or 'familyMovies' to
  <code>movies</code> in our <code>v-for</code> block. Second, instead of
  statially rendering the header of the component, we're taking in some dynamic
  information called <code>genre</code>. Finally, notice that we're using props
  here, so where are those props coming from? Remember that props have to be
  passed to a component by a parent, so let's take a look at what
  <code>App.vue</code> looks like.
</p>
<h4>App.vue--html</h4>
<pre data-language="html">
  &lt;template&gt;
    &lt;div id="app"&gt;
      &lt;MovieList :movies="familyMovies" genre="Comedy" /&gt;
      &lt;MovieList :movies="comedyMovies" genre="Family" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/template&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  Again, so far not much has changed. Instead of rendering specific components,
  we're rendering one more genral component twice and passing properties into
  them from the App component. Let's see what the script looks like.
</p>
<h4>App.vue--script</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  import { mapGetters } from "vuex";
  import MovieList from "./components/MovieList.vue";
  
  export default {
    name: "app",
    components: {
      MovieList
    },
    computed: {
      ...mapGetters(["comedyMovies", "familyMovies"])
    }
  };
</pre>
<p>
  Here's where things are probably starting to venture into the uncomfortable.
  The only new concept we're introducing here is the
  <code>mapGetters</code> function. Notice that <code>mapGetters</code> is
  imported from Vuex above. Also, notice that because
  <code>mapGetters</code> returns an object, we can use the
  <strong>spread operator</strong> to our advantage. Find out more about the js
  spread operator
  <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax#Spread_in_object_literals"
    >here</a
  >. What <code>mapGetters</code> is doing is going to the store object to find
  the "getters" property. If one of the properties in that object matches one of
  the strings in the given array, it will add that computed property to the
  object it will return. Once it returns said object, we use the spread operator
  to make a new computed property for each getter on our component. We can do
  this for any number of computed properties, and we can even include local
  computed properties that don't need to exist in the store.
</p>
<p>
  This code works, and it's already a huge improvement from our previous
  version, but there's still room for improvement. Both of our getters do almost
  the same thing. Just as we'd like to reuse components as much as possible,
  we'd also like to reuse any of our functions when we can. In the next lesson,
  we'll continue building our knowledge of getters to make our application
  better.
