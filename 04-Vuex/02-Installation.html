<h1>Vuex Installation</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Learn how to install Vuex</li>
  <li>Start using Vuex with a simple store example</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's start by installing Vuex. We'll go ahead and assume you've created a demo project for this using the vue-cli tool. Once you've navigated into your demo project folder, run the following command.</p>
<pre data-language="bash">npm install vuex --save</pre>
<p>Here, we've used "Node Package Manager", or "npm" to install vuex. Where did that go? Vuex and all its associated dependencies are stored inside the <code>node_modules/</code> folder in your project. But you'll also see Vuex listed as a dependency in your <code>package.json</code> file. We won't dwell on this any longer, let's start using Vuex by building a counter app!
