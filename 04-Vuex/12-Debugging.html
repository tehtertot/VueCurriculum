  <li>Learn how to debug Vuex</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We've been talking all about how Vuex makes things easier to debug, so let's
  see how! Vue has a really useful chrome extension called Vue.js devtools. You
  can install it using
  <a
    href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd?hl=en"
    >this link</a
  >. Now, open up your newly created Ninja Gold project (or any project using
  Vuex) and open it in your chrome browser. With your Vue app open and the
  chrome extension installed, go ahead and open up your web inspector. There
  should now be a Vue tab.
</p>
<p>
  The Vue extension will recognize when the browser is running a Vue application
  and add the Vue tab to the inspector any time the page is running Vue!
  Take some time to poke around. You should be able to see the component
  hierarchy, the history of state as we commit mutations, routing history,
  performance, and more. This combined with the chrome devtools is a powerful
  combination for figuring out what's going on on your front-end.
</p>
<p>
  Spend some time playing around with your various apps and watching how the
  devtools update!
