<h1>Vuex Mutations</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Learn about mutating state with Vuex mutations</li>
  <li>Learn about when to use mutations</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Okay so we know how to use getters and we've refactored our application so
  that code reuse is optimal. But getting data from the store is only half the
  battle. Pretty soon, we'll realize that we need to be able to update our
  application's state. Before, we just made methods in our store object; now,
  the only difference is that we'll call our update functions "mutations".
</p>
<p>
  Let's imagine a scenario where we want to change our application into a movie
  ratings application, where users can give each movie upvotes and downvotes in
  a manner similar to Reddit or Stack Overflow. To do this, we'll need some new
  features like "upvote" and "downvote" buttons. These buttons need to exist
  next to each movie, and they should modify the state of their associated
  movie. Because these buttons are so tightly coupled in both where they appear
  on the page and how they affect the data, it makes sense to make a new
  component for movies called <code>MovieListItem</code>. This new component
  will contain all the code we had in the <code>li</code> elements in our
  <code>MovieList</code> components as well as the new "upvote" and "downvote"
  buttons. Let's take a look at how the code might change starting with the
  <code>MovieList</code> component.
</p>
<h4>MovieList.vue--html</h4>
<pre data-language="html">
  &lt;template&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;{{ genre }}&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;MovieListItem v-for="movie in movies" :movie="movie" :key="movie.id" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/template&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  Okay, so far there isn't much change. Notice the new component
  <code>MovieListItem</code>. We're passing a <code>key</code> property and a
  <code>movie</code> property to the component. We know that <code>key</code> is
  just necessary in order to use <code>v-for</code>. The movie property is the
  entire movie, enabling the <code>MovieListItem</code> to handle its own data.
  There will be a few small changes coming up to this component's script, but
  let's first take a look at what the MovieListItem component looks like.
</p>
<h4>MovieListItem.vue--html</h4>
<pre data-language="html">
  &lt;template&gt;
    &lt;div class="movie"&gt;
      &lt;h5&gt;{{ movie.title }}&lt;/h5&gt;
      &lt;span class="score"&gt;score: {{ movie.score }}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;div class="voting-buttons-container"&gt;
        &lt;button @click="onUpvote()"&gt;Upvote&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;button @click="onDownvote()"&gt;Downvote&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/template&gt;
</pre>
<h4>MovieListItem.vue--script</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  export default {
    name: "MovieListItem",
    props: {
      movie: {
        id: Number,
        score: Number,
        title: String,
        genre: String
      }
    },
    methods: {
      onUpvote() {
        this.$store.commit("incrementMovieScore", this.movie.id);
      },
      onDownvote() {
        this.$store.commit("decrementMovieScore", this.movie.id);
      }
    }
  };
</pre>
<p>
  We'll talk about the methods soon, but notice how we're defining the prop
  types of every key in the expected <code>movie</code> property. This just
  keeps everything nice and tidy and will help us catch errors moving forward.
  Now notice that our <code>onUpvote</code> and <code>onDownvote</code> methods
  are both calling <code>this.$store.commit()</code>. The
  <code>commit</code> function is how we tell the Vuex store to actually run one
  of our mutations. Our mutations are just functions (we'll take a look at them
  in just a moment) and we're calling upon them by name. This allows Vuex to
  keep a record of all the mutations we've made in order, because it's
  constantly keeping track of when the <code>commit</code> function is called
  upon.
</p>
<p>Okay, now it's time for the big reveal. Let's take a look at the store.</p>
<h4>main.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  const store = new Vuex.Store({
    state: {
      movies: [
        { id: 1, score: 0, title: 'The Hangover', genre: 'Comedy' },
        { id: 2, score: 0, title: 'I Love You Man', genre: 'Comedy' },
        { id: 3, score: 0, title: 'Cars', genre: 'Family' },
        { id: 4, score: 0, title: 'Toy Story', genre: 'Family' },
      ],
    },
    getters: {
      sortedMoviesByGenre: state => genre => {
        const filteredMovies = state.movies.filter(
        movie => movie.genre === genre
        );
        return filteredMovies.sort(
          (movieA, movieB) => movieB.score - movieA.score
        );
      },
    },
    mutations: {
      incrementMovieScore(state, movieId) {
        const movieToIncrement = state.movies.find(movie => movie.id === movieId);
        const updatedMovie = {
          ...movieToIncrement,
          score: movieToIncrement.score + 1,
        };
        state.movies = [
          updatedMovie,
          ...state.movies.filter(movie => movie.id !== movieId),
        ];
      },
      decrementMovieScore(state, movieId) {
        const movieToDecrement = state.movies.find(movie => movie.id === movieId);
        const updatedMovie = {
          ...movieToDecrement,
          score: movieToDecrement.score - 1,
        };
        state.movies = [
          updatedMovie,
          ...state.movies.filter(movie => movie.id !== movieId),
        ];
      },
    },
  });
</pre>
<p>
  Okay this is a lot of new stuff. It looks like our store is getting to be
  pretty big, and there is probably some code that looks pretty cryptic. Let's
  break it down piece by piece.
</p>
<h4>state</h4>
<p>
  The only thing we changed here is we added a <code>score</code> property to
  each movie. That way, we can keep track of the sum of all the up/down votes.
</p>
<h4>mutations</h4>
<p>
  This is the bread and butter of this lesson so reread this section a few times
  and do your best to understand how the code is actually working. At a high
  level: we're accepting an id for a movie, finding it in the movies array in
  state, updating the movie's score, and then updating the movies array with the
  new movie. We'll dive into the actual code, but we want you to understand
  <em>why</em> we made the decisions we made here. Remember that when we're
  dealing with Vuex state, we never want to update an object (or array)
  directly. Instead, we always want to create a copy of that object, change it,
  and overwrite it. This is because of how Vue's
  <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html">reactivity system</a>
  works. If you take nothing else away from this let it be that you should
  <strong>NEVER MUTATE STATE DIRECTLY</strong>. This ensures that our components
  always update reliably with the correct information.
</p>
<p>
  Here, we're using lots of new javascript features and built-ins to our
  advantage, so let's deconstruct <code>incrementMovieScore</code> line by line.
  Take a look at the commented code below.
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  incrementMovieScore(state, movieId) {
    // use js Array.find() to get the movie object whose id matches movieId
    const movieToIncrement = state.movies.find(movie => movie.id === movieId);
    // make a copy of movieToIncrement using the spread operator
    // update the movie's score to its previous score + 1
    const updatedMovie = {
      ...movieToIncrement,
      score: movieToIncrement.score + 1,
    };
    // overwrite state.movies with updatedMovie and all other movies
    state.movies = [
      updatedMovie,
      ...state.movies.filter(movie => movie.id !== movieId),
    ];
  }
</pre>
<p>
  Both <code>filter</code> and <code>find</code> are taking advantage of the
  "concise function body" in their respective callbacks. Check out docs for that
  <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#Function_body"
    >here</a
  >. You can also find the docs for <code>.find()</code>
  <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find"
    >here</a
  >
  and <code>.filter()</code
  ><a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter"
    >here</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  Take a glance back at how we're calling our
  <code>incrementMovieScore</code> function in our
  <code>MovieListItem</code> component. Vuex passes the state object as the
  first parameter for us, but we can pass an optional second parameter if we
  need additional information in our function. This works as-is, but it might be
  necessary to pass multiple arguments. You can read about how you might
  accomplish that
  <a href="https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/mutations.html#commit-with-payload"
    >here</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, let's quickly revisit <code>MovieList</code>. Right now, the code
  just works, but there is some weird behavior. Any time we click one of our
  buttons, the movies seem to randomly reorganize. What's happening? Whenever we
  overwrite <code>state.movies</code> we haven't taken into account the new
  <em>order</em> that those movies will be in. Now that we're building a Reddit
  style rating app, we might as well sort the movies by their score. We can do
  that in our MovieList component.
</p>
<h4>MovieList.vue--script</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  import MovieListItem from "@/components/MovieListItem.vue";

  export default {
    name: "MovieList",
    components: {
      MovieListItem
    },
    props: {
      genre: String
    },
    computed: {
      movies() {
      return this.$store.getters
        .moviesByGenre(this.genre)
        .sort((movieA, movieB) => movieB.score - movieA.score);
      }
    }
  };
</pre>
<p>
  Here, we're chaining our <code>moviesByGenre</code> array into the js
  <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort"
    >sort function</a
  >
  to keep our items in the proper order!
