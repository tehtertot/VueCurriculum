<h1>Module Namespacing</h1>

  By default, Vuex takes all the properties from our modules and attaches them
  to the root store object. That means that we can access anything from a module
  the same way we would access anything else. However, this can lead to a few
  drawbacks. As our app grows, we may find that our mutation and action names
  are starting to look pretty similar. If we have two that happen to end up with
  the same name, Vuex will just use the one that was added to the store last.
  Also, we may find that having everything globally accessible makes things
  harder to find when we need them. Often, this ends up in certain enforced
  naming conventions like "usersIncrementCount" vs "tweetsIncrementCount". In
  these cases, it can be useful to use a Vuex module feature called
  "namespacing".
</p>
<p>
  Namespacing nests each module within its own unique name and essentially
  forces us to use the name of the module any time we'd like to use any of its
  properties. This gives us much more flexibility to write modules freely
  without worrying about naming conficts and gives us more understandable code
  over time. Let's see namespacing in action with our Twitter example.
</p>
<h4>/store/users.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  export default {
    namespaced: true,
    state: {
      currentUser: {
        id: 1,
        name: "Wes Harper"
      }
    },
  }
</pre>
<h4>/store/tweets.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  export default {
    namespaced: true,
    state: {
      tweets: [
        {
          id: 1,
          content: "coding is fun!"
        },
        {
          id: 2,
          content: "Vue is cool!"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
</pre>
<p>And finally...</p>
<h4>main.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  import users from "store/users"
  import tweets from "store/tweets"

  // omitted for brevity
  const store = new Vuex.Store({
    modules: {
      users,
      tweets
    }
  })
  // omitted for brevity
</pre>
<p>
  Notice that the only real change is the addition of the "namespaced" key.
  There's also one slight change to how we'll access this information from
  within our components. Let's imagine that we have a Tweet component.
</p>
<h4>Tweet.vue</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  // imports omitted for brevity
  export default {
    name: 'tweet',
    data() {
      ...mapState('tweets', ['tweets']),
      ...mapState(['users/user'])
    }
  }
</pre>
<p>
  The above snippet shows two different ways of accessing namespaced state. The
  first uses the first parameter of the mapState function to define the module
  that we'll be accessing. In the subsequent array, we only have access to any
  state that's nested inside the "tweets" module. In the second example, we're
  prepending the namespace path from the root to the state that we'd like to
  access. Since the module is called "users", we start with "users/" and since
  the state we want to access is called "user", we end with "user". Either way
  is acceptable, but we find that there are typically fewer keystrokes used on
  the first option.
