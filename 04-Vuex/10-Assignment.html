<h1>Ninja Gold With Vuex</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use Vuex to manage state in a real application</li>
</ul>
<p>
  It's time to revisit the Ninja Gold assignment. Rewrite your assignment using
  getters and mutations. It's probably worth starting your project from scratch
  to get some extra practice. Then you can compare and contrast your initial
  approach to what your app looks like with Vuex.
