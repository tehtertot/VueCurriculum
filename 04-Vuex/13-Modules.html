<h1>Vuex Modules</h1>

  <li>Learn how to use modules in Vuex</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Now that we've been building our own applications in Vuex and working with
  some examples, it's probably not hard to imagine things getting really out of
  control when we're writing an app that has a bigger scope. From the very
  beginning, we've been touting the benefits of modularization, and keeping all
  of our data management logic stuck inside the <code>main.js</code> file is
  obviously not very modular. Luckily, Vuex allows us to modularize all our Vuex
  methods into separate modules. This allows us to split everything up into
  separate files and folders based on what makes sense for our application. For
  instance, if we were building Twitter, we might have a "users" module and a
  "tweets" module, each with their own respective state, getters, mutations, and
  actions.
</p>
<p>
  Vuex doesn't enforce any rules regarding <em>how</em> we decide to modularize
  our store, but the package maintainers do recommend a specific application
  structure. You can find that structure
  <a href="https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/structure.html">here</a>. Modules
  themselves are just normal JavaScript objects that have our familiar keys:
  "state", "getters", "mutations", and "actions". Let's look at a simple example
  using our Twitter scenario.
</p>
<h4>/store/users.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  export default {
    state: {
      currentUser: {
        id: 1,
        name: "Wes Harper"
      }
    },
  }
</pre>
<h4>/store/tweets.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  export default {
    state: {
      tweets: [
        {
          id: 1,
          content: "coding is fun!"
        },
        {
          id: 2,
          content: "Vue is cool!"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
</pre>
<p>And finally...</p>
<h4>main.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  import users from "store/users"
  import tweets from "store/tweets"

  // omitted for brevity
  const store = new Vuex.Store({
    modules: {
      users,
      tweets
    }
  })
  // omitted for brevity
</pre>
<p>
  Notice that the only real change is the addition of the "modules" key. If we
  needed or wanted to, we can also include any number of getters, mutations,
  actions, and even state data to the root of our store directly and use them
  alongside our modules!
