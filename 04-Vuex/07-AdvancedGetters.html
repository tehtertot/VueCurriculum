  Now that we've explored getters, it's time to dive into the true power that
  we're wielding. If we could rewrite our getter so that we could reuse it just
  like we're reusing our MovieList component, then our app can truly scale to
  hundreds of different genres and all we'd have to do is add one line of code
  to support a new one. That's pretty flippin' awesome.
</p>
<p>
  In order to do this, we'll need our getter to accept an argument, in this case
  a genre, that we can use to filter the store's list of movies. And in order to
  do <em>that</em>, we'll need to explore an advanced pattern where we pass a
  function to our Vuex getter. Check out our new store.
</p>
<h4>main.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  const store = new Vuex.Store({
    state: {
      movies: [
        { id: 1, title: 'The Hangover', genre: 'Comedy' },
        { id: 2, title: 'I Love You Man', genre: 'Comedy' },
        { id: 3, title: 'Cars', genre: 'Family' },
        { id: 4, title: 'Toy Story', genre: 'Family' },
      ],
    },
    getters: {
      moviesByGenre: state => genre => {
        return state.movies.filter(movie => movie.genre === genre);
      },
    },
  });
</pre>
<p>
  This may look super weird and confusing (it sort of is), but this works due to
  a programming technique called "currying". If the sound of that sends shudders
  down your spine, then for now just know that you can make a getter return a
  function, and if that's the case you can pass arguments to that function. For
  those of you who are brave enough to dive into the concept of currying, take a
  look at

  and talk to your instructor.
</p>
<p>
  Just so that we're all on the same page, <code>moviesByGenre</code> is a
  property that stores a function. The function takes a parameter, where it will
  receive the store's state object and it returns a function. The function our
  function returns (sorry) takes a parameter for genre. Using that
  <code>genre</code> parameter, we can do our filter.
</p>
<p>Whew, okay so how does that change our app?</p>
<h4>App.vue--html</h4>
<pre data-language="html">
  &lt;template&gt;
    &lt;div id="app"&gt;
      &lt;MovieList genre="Comedy" /&gt;
      &lt;MovieList genre="Family" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/template&gt;
</pre>
<h4>App.vue--script</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  import MovieList from "./components/MovieList.vue";
  
  export default {
    name: "app",
    components: {
      MovieList
    }
  };
</pre>
<p>
  Looking at our <code>App.vue</code> file we can see we've simplified the code
  quite a bit. We're only passing one property to the
  <code>MovieList</code> component, and we're no longer mapping our getters into
  computed properties. We've transitioned our MovieList components so that
  they're able to be responsible for their own data. This allows our
  <code>App.vue</code> to be more or less ignorant of the data used by its
  children and simplifies the code. Now let's look at <code>MovieList</code>.
</p>
<h4>MovieList.vue--html</h4>
<pre data-language="html">
  &lt;template&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;{{ genre }}&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li v-for="movie in movies" :key="movie.id"&gt;{{
    movie.title
  }}&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/template&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  Notice how the html (or template) hasn't changed at all! Let's move ahead to
  the script!
</p>
<h4>MovieList.vue--script</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  export default {
    name: "MovieList",
    props: {
      genre: String
    },
    computed: {
      movies() {
        return this.$store.getters.moviesByGenre(this.genre);
      }
    }
  };
</pre>
<p>
  Notice again that we only need one property here. We're not using
  <code>mapGetters</code> because we need to pass our property to the
  <code>moviesByGenre</code> function. Now that our filter is "genre agnostic",
  it doesn't matter what genre we're given in our component and it will go find
  the movies that match! Our component is now fully responsible for itself, and
  can be reused ad nauseam.
</p>
<h2>A final note:</h2>
<p>
  We've explored some pretty cool things in this lesson, but it's important to
  note a couple drawbacks with this approach. First, we still have the problem of
  our <code>MovieList</code> component being "tightly coupled" with an external
  property. This means, if we decide to change the name of our genre from
  "Romantic Comedy" to "RomCom" in our store, but we forget to change it in
  App.vue, we're going to have a broken application. Secondly, something that's
  important to note is that the performance of getters that return functions is
  slightly worse than those that do not. Getters that return functions are not
  able to be as intelligent and trigger a re-render of the component more often.
  Sometimes this is a tradeoff that we're willing to take on for simpler code,
  but sometimes it's not. Keep that in mind. You can explore more about all the
  things you can do with getters in the
