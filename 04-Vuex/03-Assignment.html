<h1>My First Vuex Store</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Practice using documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>We've shown you some important pieces of the puzzle, but those pieces alone are by no means a working project. Try to create a counter project of your own using the Vuex documentation found <a href="https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/">here</a>. We're having you go through this exercise because you won't always have an instructor by your side. At some point, you'll need to use the bits and pieces of documentation on your own to build a working project. Don't dive too deep into the weeds here. Spend about 15-20 minutes figuring things out and then download <a href="">this</a> example project to see how we did it. Compare your work with what we've done and be sure to ask your instructor if you have any questions!</p>
