<h2>What is routing?</h2>
<p>Traditionally, as we navigate through a website, the URL found in the browser's address bar tells the site which part of the application we are currently viewing, or which action we are taking. Users can bookmark these URLs so they can get directly to a commonly visited section of the site, rather than having to navigate to it manually on every visit; the browser also uses these URLs to help manage a user's navigation history, thus allowing users to hit the back or forward buttons and navigate the site accordingly.</p>
<p>Have you ever been to a site where you hit the back button and it took you much further back than you expected or wanted? That's a result of poor routing management, likely in combination with an implementation of a single-page application.</p>
<h2>Vue Router</h2>
<p>Because this is such a common and important task, even though it is not inherently built in to the Vue framework, the community has collaborated and developed a package called Vue Router that can help manage routing for us.</p>
