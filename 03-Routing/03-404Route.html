<hr>
<p>You may have noticed that if you request a URL that doesn't match any of the pre-determined routes, the <code>router-view</code> component doesn't get replaced and just sits empty. For a better user experience, we can add a catch-all route that displays a 404 page, which means the requested page was not found. To do so, we use the special character <code>*</code> in our path, which matches anything:</p>
<h4>src/router/index.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
    // imports
    // all other routes (removed for brevity)
    {
        path: '*',
        component: NotFound     // assuming we've made a NotFound component
    }
</pre>
<p>Again, remember that route order matters! The catch all route should always be last.</p>
