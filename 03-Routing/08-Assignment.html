</ul>

<p>Continue building off of your previous DojoReviews assignment. From every view, make sure there is a link to the home page (including on pages not seen in the wireframe below). Then, update the restaurant section so that there are links to each of the different child component routes, as shown:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
