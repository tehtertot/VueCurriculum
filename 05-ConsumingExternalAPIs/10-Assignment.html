<p>We're finally ready to battle! Building off of your previous GitHub assignment, we're going to build an application where you can input 2 usernames and compare their status. Before we get to that though, start by ensuring that if an invalid username is entered (i.e. there is no GitHub user associated with that username), an error message is displayed.</p>
<p>Once you've got that working, update the app so that there are 2 spots available for usernames to be entered. (Reusability of components for the win!!) Add a BATTLE button at the bottom. When this is clicked, display the winner of the battle!</p>
