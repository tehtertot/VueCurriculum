<h1>Adding Axios to our Vue Application</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Learn how to make an API call from within our Vue application</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Now that we have an understanding of axios's functionality, let's integrate it into a Vue application. After creating a new Vue project, install the axios package by running this command while in the new project folder:</p>
<pre data-language="bash">
    first-vue-with-api$ npm install axios --save
</pre>
<p>We'll then need to configure our project to use this tool. To make axios available to us in any component, we'll add it as a property to our Vue application:</p>
<h4>first-vue-with-api/src/main.js</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
    // other imports
    import axios from 'axios';

    Vue.prototype.$http = axios;

    new Vue({
        ...
</pre>
<p>Here, we've added a property to our Vue application named <code>$http</code>, which gives us access to all the functionality of axios. Let's update the pre-made HelloWorld component to use axios. To start, we just want to put the result of the request directly on display:</p>
<h4>first-vue-with-api/src/components/HelloWorld.vue</h4>
<h4>template section</h4>
<pre data-language="html">
    &lt;div class="hello"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The result of our request: {{ info }}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>This means we'll need a data variable called <code>info</code> to hold the response received from the request. We'll initialize it with a null value, and then set its value once we've received a response:</p>
<h4>first-vue-with-api/src/components/HelloWorld.vue</h4>
<h4>script section</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
    export default {
        name: 'HelloWorld',
        data() {
            return {
                info: null
            };
        },
        mounted() {
            this.getBerryData();
        },
        methods: {
            async getBerryData() {
                try {
                    let response = await this.$http.get("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/berry/42");
                    this.info = response.data;      // a lot more information comes back in the response, so for now we only want the actual data of the response
                }
                catch(error) {
                    console.log(`Something went wrong: ${error}`);
                }
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>Run the application and see what happens! Change the url to something you know will throw an error, and check the browser console for the logged error.</p>
