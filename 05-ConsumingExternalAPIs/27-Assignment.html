<h1>Assignment: Login/Registration Part I</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new Vue application with Firebase</li>
    <li>Set up a basic login/registration page to prepare for the next assignment</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>We aren't quite ready to make a completely <em>functional</em> login and registration page, but this assignment will set us up for integrating this functionality shortly. For this application, be sureto set up all the Firebase configurations as shown in the previous module.</p>
<p>Be sure to set up data variables for each of the input fields using <code>v-model</code>. While we don't have a backend ready to save usernames and passwords yet, we can still perform some <em>front-end validations</em>. With front-end validations, we can reduce unnecessary backend calls because we can check for basic requirements and notify the user if these are not meant. For example, if any required fields are missing, there is no reason to make a request to the backend.</p>
