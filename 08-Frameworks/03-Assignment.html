<h1>Pretty Cool</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Practice using bootstrap-vue</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Take no more than 30 minutes reworking an old assignment or building something
  from scratch that uses bootstrap-vue. Get the hang of things and move on.
  Don't worry if you're still not an expert once your 30 minutes is up. There's
  plenty of time to learn frameworks like this and there are more important
  concepts to focus on during your time at Coding Dojo.
