  Nowadays, users are getting engaged with applications from all over the world,
  on all kinds of different devices. Whether it's a mobile phone, desktop
  computer, voice activated assistant, or another device, developers are
  consistently having to meet consumers where they are. This has created a
  pretty significant demand for creating apps that meet multiple needs. For
  instance, our web app may need to be delivered on a mobile phone, or even on
  desktop! Think about how silly it would be if we couldn't use an app like
  Slack or Mattermost from our phones, desktop, and the web! They wouldn't be
  nearly as compelling as products! However, this can be problematic. What if
  our app is gaining traction and we just don't have the expertise on the team
  to build native computer and mobile apps? Well, we're in luck because of
  frameworks like Quasar! Quasar is Vue's answer to similar products like React
  Native or Flutter. It allows us to take our Vue application and deliver it as
  a native application on all sorts of different major platforms without
  changing the codebase!

<h4>A caveat before we start</h4>
<p>
  Quasar is really, really cool. It's amazing how far some of the developer
  tools have come in recent years. However, many, many companies still find the
  need to create their own custom native applications. While tools like Quasar
  can do a lot, there's still a lot of work to do in the field before an option
  like this is compelling to large companies. Quasar promises a host of
  different applications with one codebase, but in reality things are always
  more complicated than that. For instance, if you need to implement native
  alerts on iOS and Android, you'll have to implement custom solutions for each
  platform. While your user interface might be in Vue, you're still going to
  find yourself in a situation where custom native code is required. Depending
  on the number of applications you need to support, your code base is also
  liable to get bloated and unruly. Separating concerns is a tried-and-true
  computer programming technique and this can make your code much harder to work
  with. Quasar also still requires a decent amount of platform specific
  knowledge to get up and running. All that being true, here are some good times
  to use Quasar for your application:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    You're working on a hobby project and just want to play around with it
  </li>
  <li>Your team can't afford to hire native engineers</li>
  <li>
    Your app is small and won't need access to many device APIs (things the
    phone software does natively like send an alert)
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Moving on</h4>
<p>
  Okay, now that that's out of the way, let's talk about some of the underlying
  technology that makes Quasar work and some similar options. Quasar uses a tool
  called <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a> to create native
  mobile apps. Cordova is used in tools like Ionic for Android and is made by
  the Apache foundation. Another option for doing this particular task in Vue is
  <a href="https://www.nativescript.org/vue">NativeScript</a>. Quasar also
  handles SPA, SSR, and PWA support, which are pretty well supported by both
  <code>vue-cli</code> and <code>Nuxt</code>. Finally, we can build native
  desktop applications in Quasar using
  <a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a>. Electron can be used with Vue
  on its own, and is what many popular apps are built with, including VSCode and
  Slack. Whether you choose to run with Quasar or pick and choose from
  competitors based on your needs is up to you, but we'll cover a simple Quasar
  powered app in the next example!
