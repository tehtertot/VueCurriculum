<h2>A Vue Recap</h2>
<p>
  Something you may or may not have been aware of is that when we build a Vue
  project, our browser isn't interpreting html and css in a traditional way. The
  beauty of Vue and other frameworks like it is that we can give the
  responsibility for the entire user interface to the user's browser. This was
  always the case, but Vue takes things to the next level. We can build entire
  apps and sub-apps and pages that all work by just rendering one html file and
  letting Vue do the rest. For instance, let's say we have a "Home" page and an
  "About" page. If we're using <code>vue-router</code> to render those pages,
  the actual page changes are a bit of an illusion. Traditionally, if we wanted
  to load a different page, we'd have to request that page from a server and
  refresh our browser once that information gets sent back. With Vue, we just
  use javascript to rip out all the html and put in new html without ever
  leaving the site. This has many, many performance benefits, and can make
  websites blazing fast. However, there are some limitations.
</p>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>
  So what's the downside if our apps are way faster? Unfortunately, search
  engines like Google request content for web pages in order to do their
  "indexing" of the internet. If all of your content technically lives in Vue,
  then it all technically lives in JavaScript land. You're not necessarily
  sending html to the browser in the traditional sense. Sure, there will be some
  html on the page, but Vue is responsible for deciding what will be there. If
  the search engine isn't running JavaScript when it does its indexing, you'll
  end up with a bunch of empty pages. That's no good. Often times, it's really
  important to have good search engine optimization or "SEO" so that users can
  easily find your websites across the web. If you can't Google your website and
  find it in the first few results, you're in trouble. So what's the solution to
  this problem?
</p>
<h2>Old is the new new</h2>
<p>
  To solve for the SEO problem, developers have taken a page out of the old days
  and begun pre-rendering their Vue apps on their server. This way, we still get
  to use the expressive Vue framework to build our user interface, but we can
  have all the benefits of rendering the page on the server. This is called
  server side rendering, or "SSR". Aside from SEO, there are a couple other
  benefits. For instance, if we write our code intelligently, we can actually
  improve how long it takes for a user to be able to see content and interact
  with a page. Pretty neat!
</p>
<h3>Aren't we already using a server?</h3>
<p>
  If you remember deployment, you may have noticed that we were already using a
  server to "serve" our Vue applications on the web, so how is SSR different
  from what we've already done? The key difference is that instead of sending
  <strong>all</strong> of the contents of our app all at once, we'll be using a
  pre-processor to compile our Vue page into pure html, css, and javascript
  before we send it back to the browser. We typically do this one page at a
  time. This can complicate our server logic, but luckily there are some pretty
  robust tools out there for us to do server side rendering.
</p>
<h2>When should we use SSR?</h2>
<p>
  Server side rendering can be overkill for many projects, and support for
  properly indexing SPAs (Single Page Applications) is growing. It's best to use
  SSR when you need more control over your page, if your page load times are
  starting to slow down, or if SEO is the absolute first priority of your
  project. Otherwise, it's probably okay to start with an SPA and grow into
  using SSR down the road.
