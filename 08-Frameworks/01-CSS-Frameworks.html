<h2>CSS Frameworks</h2>
<p>
  Just because Vue has lots of neat features (like scoped styling) that make it
  easier to create and reason about styling an app from scratch, doesn't mean
  that there isn't a robust community of developers supporting some of the most
  popular tools for writing CSS in the market. In fact, using the `create`
  command in the Vue CLI (command line interface) will offer options for using
  some of the most popular CSS "preprocessors" like SASS and LESS. If you don't
  know about CSS preprocessors, you can check out

    >this article</a
  >. You may notice the date on this article. Frameworks like Vue and React have
  made it way easier to manage CSS at scale, subsequently reducing some of the
  emphasis placed on CSS preprocessors. The same is true about CSS frameworks,
  but there are some benefits CSS frameworks like Bootstrap can still give us
  when it comes to delivering a product that's consistent and on-time.
</p>
<p>
  Frameworks like Bootstrap and Materialize are great standalone tools for CSS
  that can greatly accelerate the development speed of a team building a product
  that wants to deliver a product quickly without worrying too much about
  styling. Frameworks take some of the pressure out of building a CSS hierarchy
  and structure and come bundled with lots of great looking elements and useful
  classes out of the box. If you were just working in html and CSS you might
  just add some classes to your HTML elements and call it a day. In Vue, we'll
  use an npm package like `bootstrap-vue` to get access to a host of custom
  elements that have pre-built functionality and behavior.

  If you're already familiar with using a framework like Bootstrap,
  bootstrap-vue should be very similar to what you're already used to. If not,
  don't worry, but
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_ver.asp">this link</a>
  might be a good place to start. It's a good idea to take 15-20 minutes
  learning Bootstrap just to get a feel for what a CSS framework can accomplish.

<h3>Why frameworks?</h3>
<p>
  If you asked 10 different developers whether or not they think CSS frameworks
  should be used, you'd get 10 different answers. There are people who will say
  that if you really care what your website looks like and want a custom feel,
  then you're better off just doing everything from scratch. However, there are
  some real benefits to using a framework, here are just a few:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You're working on a proof of concept project</li>
  <li>Your team doesn't have a design focus</li>
  <li>
    You don't want to enforce your own structure and rules around creating CSS
    classes and hierarchy
  </li>
  <li>
    The CSS framework you want to use looks pretty similar to what your product
    will eventually need to look like
  </li>
  <li>You otherwise have trouble with responsive design</li>
  <li>
    You're a student looking to get a job at a company that uses a CSS framework
    *wink wink*
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Whatever the reason, it's important to know about how to use CSS frameworks so
  that you're prepared if the need arises. Let's go ahead and start using a CSS
  framework with a Vue project using `bootstrap-vue`.
