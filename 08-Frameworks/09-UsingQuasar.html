  While Quasar is a super powerful tool, bundling for mobile phones requires
  access to devices and software that we can't guarantee. It also introduces
  platform-specific considerations that go above and beyond the scope of this
  course. You can always read the full Quasar documentation
  <a href="https://quasar.dev/start/pick-quasar-flavour">here</a>. For now,
  we'll follow the instructions for Quasar and Electron to build a really
  simple, usable desktop application.
</p>
<p>
  Let's start by installing all the necessary tools and packages. First, run
  <code>npm install -g @quasar/cli</code> to install the quasar cli globally.
  Once that's complete, run <code>quasar create cross-platform</code>. Just like
  the vue-cli or Nuxt, the create command will make a new project called
  cross-platform. The defaults are fine for now until it prompts you to use yarn
  or npm, but take note of the prompts. Use npm and let's see what our app looks
  like! Open up your app and run <code>quasar dev</code> to get it running. A
  window should open in your default browser with your Quasar app! Notice the
  similarities between Quasar and Nuxt. While all of the code is in the
  <code>src</code> folder now, there are some noticeable similarities between
  file structures! Unlike Nuxt, you'll have to setup your own router, but it
  should look familiar because it uses vue-router!
</p>
<p>
  Now let's kill our running server and build a desktop app. In development,
  it's pretty straightforward. Let's just run
  <code>quasar dev -m electron</code>. If you watch the logs in the console,
  you'll see it install electron and get your app up and running! In your native
  operating system, a brand new application should open with the browser dev
  tools open. What's happening is Electron has created a version of Chrome and
  using your app, bundled all of the code into one specific desktop application
  that can use modern web languages! Since VSCode and Slack are built on
  Electron, you can even open up the chrome dev tools inside those apps if
  you're feeling adventurous!

  Quasar can do a ton, but hopefully this example illustrates the sheer power in
  the framework. If you want to learn more about security concerns, deployment,
  creating app icons, configuration, or anything else about Quasar, follow the
  guide <a href="https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js">here</a>. You
  should have enough skills in your pocket to be able to pick things up. Play
  around for a while and ask your instructor if you need help with any concepts
  you're seeing in the documentation! Can you notice any similarities between
  preFetch and any other concepts we've covered before?
