<p>
  When we're talking about optimizing pages for search engines, often that means
  we have to retrieve data and insert it into our page before we ever send it to
  the browser. That way, search engines can look through the content. If we were
  just rendering Vue as an SPA, we'd typically be getting information from a
  server somewhere and rendering the page before we have some of the data.
  Sometimes this is okay and unimportant for indexing. Sometimes it's not. Let's
  talk about your options if we need to pre-load data before we send our page to
  the browser.
</p>
<p>
  Just like we can use the built-in Vue method <code>data</code> to set our data
  on our component, Nuxt gives us the ability to use a method called
  <code>asyncData</code>. We use it in almost the exact same way we would use
  data, except with a bit of additional flexibility. Let's see it in action
  using data from the star wars api.
</p>
<h4>index.vue--template</h4>
<pre data-language="html">
  &lt;template&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Star Wars Example&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li v-for="planet in planets" :key="planet.id"&gt;{{
    planet.name
  }}&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/template&gt;
</pre>
<h4>index.vue--script</h4>
<pre data-language="javascript">
  import axios from "axios";
  
  export default {
    async asyncData({ params }) {
      const { data, err } = await axios.get("https://swapi.co/api/planets");
      return {
        planets: data.results
      };
    }
  };
</pre>
<p>
  There are a few things going on here so let's break it all down. First, our
  template is looping through data that is seemingly called
  <code>planets</code>. Notice how nothing in the template has fundamentally
  changed. Now notice that instead of using <code>data()</code> we've used
  <code>asyncData()</code>. At the end of the day we still need to return an
  object, but now we can use the power of
  <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function"
    >async/await</a
  >
  to make network requests before the component is loaded. We're then
  <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Object_destructuring"
    >destructuring</a
  >
  the axios response and inserting the data from the server into our
  application. This all happens on the back-end so we don't have to worry about
  search engines seeing the content we want them to see! Just know that this
  async request will happen before the component is loaded, so if you want to
  use <code>this</code>, you're out of luck.
</p>
<h3>One more thing</h3>
<p>
  You may have noticed something in the <code>asyncData()</code> method that
  surprised you. We included <code>{ params }</code> as a parameter definition
  for our function, so what exactly is happening there? As we know, Nuxt will
  actually call asyncData <em>for us</em>. We never call it ourselves directly.
  Every time Nuxt calls <code>asyncData()</code> it will pass any url parameters
  we got from our route as an argument to our function. So why aren't we just
  using <code>params</code>, what's with the curly braces? Well, the params
  aren't the only thing being sent into our function. In fact, our function gets
  an object with various keys. We know that this object will always be
  predictable because it's coming from Nuxt, so we can use destructuring syntax
  on the object we're given right in the function definition! Now we can access
  <code>params</code> from anywhere in the function!
